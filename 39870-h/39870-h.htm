<h1>BERT WILSON,
MARATHON WINNER</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">With Flying Feet</span></h3>


<p class="cap">A thundering cheer burst from ten
thousand throats, as the three athletes, running
like deer, swung into the stretch and straightened
away for home.</p>

<p>It was the last day of the intercollegiate meet
for field and track events, and the most thrilling
feature had been reserved for the wind-up. It
was a modified Marathon of fifteen miles and the
fastest runners in the East had entered the lists.
Each college had sent the pick of its runners to
struggle for the mastery, and excitement was at
fever heat.</p>

<p>The stands were a mass of color, packed with
the partisans of the various contenders and &ldquo;rooting&rdquo;
fiercely for their favorites. The different
events&mdash;pole vaulting, hammer throwing, broad
and high jumping&mdash;had been bitterly contested,
and the victories had been only a matter of inches.
And now with the minor features disposed of, all
eyes were centered on the most important of all&mdash;the
long distance race.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>A splendid body of athletes, twenty in number,
had faced the starter, and at the crack of his pistol
had darted off like greyhounds freed from the
leash. They formed a magnificent picture of
youth and vigor as they sped around the track.
For the first mile or two they kept a fairly compact
formation; but then the line began to lengthen.
Some through weariness, others through craftiness,
fell to the rear and let the others make the pace.
By the time five miles had been covered, the sifting
process began. Brawn and wind and staying
power asserted themselves. The weaker or more
poorly conditioned dropped out altogether or
plodded hopelessly in the rear. At six miles from
the finish, only five were left, and when they entered
upon the last mile, the race had narrowed
down to three.</p>

<p>In the stands Bedlam broke loose. The excitement
that had been seething all the afternoon
reached its climax. The frantic rooters hurled
entreaties and begged their favorites to come on
and win. Old &ldquo;grads&rdquo; worked themselves into
a state bordering on apoplexy, while pretty girls
waved their flags and joined their treble to the
bass of the men. The tremendous uproar put new
life and spirit into the tired racers as they braced
themselves for the final sprint.</p>

<p>The race seemed to belong to one of the first
two who were running neck and neck. Fifty feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
behind came the third. He was tall and splendidly
built with the narrow hips and broad chest
that mark the thoroughbred. To the ordinary
observer he seemed to be out of it, in view of the
gap that separated him from the two leaders. An
expert, however, would have seen that he was running
easily and had himself well in hand. At
the half he lengthened his stride almost imperceptibly
and reduced the lead to twenty feet.</p>

<p>Then something happened. The steady lope
became a sprint; the sprint became a flight. He
came down the track like a bullet from a gun, with
eyes blazing, head erect and his legs working like
piston rods. He seemed to be flying rather than
running. Foot by foot he overtook the men in
front. They knew from the startled roar of their
partisans that he was coming, they heard the rushing
feet behind them, and they called on every
ounce of strength they had for a last desperate
effort. For a moment they held their own, but
only for a moment. With a terrific burst of speed
that brought the yelling stands to their feet, he
passed them as though they were standing still
and breasted the tape a winner, in the fastest time
ever recorded for the track.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wilson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wilson,&rdquo; shouted the
wearers of the Blue as they poured down over the
field in a frantic mob that threatened to engulf
him. In a twinkling they hoisted him on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
shoulders and carried him about the track while
their college songs went booming down the field.
They fairly fought to get near him and refused
to let him go, until at the clubhouse door he laughingly
shook himself loose and went in for his bath
and rub-down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers,&rdquo; exclaimed Reddy, the trainer
of the team, as he nearly shook his hand off, &ldquo;you
did yourself proud, Wilson, me boy. I&rsquo;m not
denying that me heart was in me mouth when the
fellows were showing you the way to the tape.
But I kept saying to myself: &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll know when
the time comes to let himself out,&rsquo; and sure enough
ye did. Ye came down that track in the last
lap like the Twentieth Century Express. Ye only
hit the high places. I never saw such running
in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; came the answer laughingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry I nearly gave you heart failure, Reddy, but
we won, and that&rsquo;s the main thing after all. I
never felt worried myself for a minute. I was
sure I had the other fellows&rsquo; number as soon as I
cared to let go. I could see that they&rsquo;d shot their
bolt when we turned into the stretch and I knew
I had plenty in reserve. I had my second wind
and felt as if I could run all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sure were all in when they staggered
over the line,&rdquo; said Reddy. &ldquo;Brady collapsed altogether
and Thornton looked like a ghost. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you&rsquo;re as fine as silk and haven&rsquo;t turned a hair.
Ye look as though ye could do it all over again,&rdquo;
he went on admiringly as he noticed the elastic
step and regular breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
glutton and I know when I have enough. But
now for the shower, Reddy, and then for the training
table. I&rsquo;m hungry as a wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his skin glowing and every muscle tingling
from the vigorous rub-down, he stepped from the
clubhouse only to run the gauntlet of the enthusiasts
who had been waiting for him at the entrance.
A mighty shout rose and hands without
number grasped his or patted him on the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Wilson?&rdquo; they
queried and the answer came in a rousing chorus:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last he escaped from his rejoicing comrades,
and in company with Dick Trent and Tom Henderson,
his special chums, started over to the college
buildings. The reaction from the terrific
strain was beginning to make itself felt. But his
heart was filled with exultation. He had fought
fiercely. He had fought fairly. And he had
fought victoriously. He had won glory for his
Alma Mater and carried her colors to triumph.
And just at that moment he would not have
changed places with the President of the United
States or the king of any country in the world.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, Bert,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that was a wonderful
sprint in the stretch. You didn&rsquo;t have legs;
they were wings. Just as the other fellows too
were thinking it was all over except the shouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Dick, &ldquo;it would have been tall
running even for a hundred yard dash. But how
you did it after running fifteen miles is beyond
me. By George, I wish I had timed you on that
last lap. I&rsquo;d have hated to be in your way as you
came tearing down to the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might have been a mix-up for a fact,&rdquo;
laughed Bert. &ldquo;That tape looked awfully good
to me and I&rsquo;d surely have felt peevish if any
one had hit it before I did. And it wasn&rsquo;t any
sure thing at that. Thornton and Brady were
certainly running some. I looked for them to
crack before they did. If they&rsquo;d had the least
bit in reserve, they might have made it hot for
me. But they&rsquo;d killed themselves off in making
the pace. I just kept trailing and watching, and
when the right moment came I made my run.
But they&rsquo;re dandy runners,&rdquo; he added, with the
generosity that was one of his leading traits, &ldquo;and
in another race they might reverse the verdict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in a thousand years,&rdquo; maintained Tom
stoutly. &ldquo;They never saw and never will see the
day they can outrun you. It&rsquo;s you for the Olympic
team all right. There&rsquo;s no one this side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
&lsquo;big pond&rsquo; who can make you take his dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; chimed in Dick, &ldquo;nor on the other side
either. There isn&rsquo;t a fellow who saw you run
to-day that wouldn&rsquo;t back you to beat anything in
Europe and America put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast fellows,&rdquo; remonstrated Bert.
&ldquo;Remember I haven&rsquo;t even made the team yet.
This is only a preliminary tryout for the Eastern
cracks. I&rsquo;ve got to come up against the Western
bunch and if all I hear is true they are going
&lsquo;great guns&rsquo; in practice. Then too they grow
some speedy sprinters in the amateur athletic clubs&mdash;regular
streaks of greased lightning. I may
prove only a false alarm when I match my wind
and speed against theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tom with fine scorn, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll worry
a lot about that, won&rsquo;t we Dick? Didn&rsquo;t Thornton
hold the American record up to to-day?&rdquo; he
demanded, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t you run rings around
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this mightn&rsquo;t have been his day,&rdquo; began
Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick mockingly, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t. Suppose
we say it was Bert Wilson&rsquo;s day and let it
go at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their faith in Bert could not be shaken, nor
was this surprising, since it was founded on repeated
incidents in their own experience. Again
and again they had seen him put to the test, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he had never failed to measure up to the emergency.
Dangers that might have daunted the
stoutest heart he had met without quailing. His
physical prowess was beyond dispute. He was a
typical athlete, strong, quick, muscular, and a
natural leader in all manly sports. In most of
them he stood head and shoulders above his fellows.
He had borne off trophy after trophy on
field and track. This alone would have marked
him out as one to be reckoned with, but it was
only a part of the reason why he was the idol
of his friends and comrades.</p>

<p>His popularity lay in the fact that his splendid
body held a heroic soul. He was clear grit
through and through. His muscles were no more
iron than his will. His beaten opponents often
grumbled that he had no nerves, but they never
questioned his nerve. He faced life with eyes
wide open and unafraid. He stood on his own
feet, asking no odds and seeking no advantage.
He never quit. There was no &ldquo;yellow streak&rdquo;
in him anywhere. To-day had only been one
more illustration of his indomitable will, his bulldog
tenacity. Add to this that he was a staunch
friend, a jolly &ldquo;pal,&rdquo; a true comrade, and there
was no mystery as to the feeling his friends had
for him.</p>

<p>None felt these qualities more strongly than his
particular chums, Tom and Dick. Their friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was one of many years standing and grew
steadily stronger as time went on. Every new
experience tightened the bond between them.
They had been with him on many occasions, some
merely exciting, others attended by personal danger,
and none had ever shown the white feather.
In all their adventures, Bert had been easily the
central figure. When as campers they had had
that thrilling automobile race it was Bert&rsquo;s hand
on the wheel that had steered the Red Scout to
its glorious victory over the Gray Ghost, its redoubtable
rival. In that last heart-breaking
game when the &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; captured the championship
of the college diamond, it was Bert&rsquo;s masterly
pitching of his great &lsquo;fadeaway&rsquo; ball that
snatched victory from defeat before twenty thousand
frenzied rooters. Only a few months before,
when acting as wireless operator on that
summer evening off the China coast, it was Bert&rsquo;s
quick wit and dauntless courage that had beaten
off the pirate attack and sent the yellow scoundrels
tumbling into their junks. Small wonder then
that they believed in him so fully and refused to
concede that he could lose in anything he undertook.
Mentally and actually they were prepared
to back him to the limit. While delighted at to-day&rsquo;s
victory they were in no way surprised. He
&ldquo;had the habit&rdquo; of winning.</p>

<p>After supper, where Bert made ample amends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for the &ldquo;short commons&rdquo; he had been under while
preparing for the race, Tom came into the rooms
that Bert and Dick shared together, for his usual
chat before bedtime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t keep you up too late, old fellow,&rdquo; he
said as he dropped into a chair. &ldquo;I suppose you
want to hit the feathers early to-night. You
must be dead tired after the race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not especially sleepy,&rdquo; replied Bert,
&ldquo;just a little lazy. I had such a big supper that
I&rsquo;m doing the anaconda stunt, just now. I&rsquo;m full
and therefore happy. I&rsquo;m at peace with all mankind.
If I&rsquo;ve an enemy in the world, I forgive
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t an enemy in this college
world just now, you can bet on that,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;The fellows are talking of nothing else than the
race this afternoon. The whole place is buzzing
with it. They&rsquo;re sure that you&rsquo;ve cinched your
place on the Olympic team beyond all question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; broke in Dick, &ldquo;how did this
Olympic idea get its start anyway? Who dug it
up? Who saw it first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;it was a Frenchman I
believe&mdash;de Coubertin or some name like that&mdash;who
suggested it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems queer too,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t usually think of the French in connection
with athletics. Of course they&rsquo;re a great nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and all that, but somehow or other they bring to
mind high heels and frock coats and waxed mustaches
and button hole bouquets. The men kiss
each other when they meet and they cry too easily.
They seem a little too delicate for the rough work
of the field and track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do seem a little womanish,&rdquo; admitted
Bert, &ldquo;but that is only a matter of custom. Don&rsquo;t
think for a minute, though, that there is anything
weak or cowardly about the French. There are
no finer fighters in the world. They go to their
death as gaily as to a dinner. No one will die
more readily for an idea. A little theatrical
about it, perhaps, but the real stuff is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re fighters sure enough,&rdquo; asserted
Dick. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re something like old Fuzzy-Wuzzy
that Kipling tells about;</p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s all &rsquo;ot sand and ginger when alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &rsquo;e&rsquo;s generally shammin&rsquo; when &rsquo;e&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; went on Bert, &ldquo;they had it
handed to them good and plenty in 1870. But
that wasn&rsquo;t due to any lack of courage on their
part. Both sides fought bravely, but the Germans
were better prepared. They caught the
French napping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it was this very affair of
1870 that started de Coubertin in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the Olympic games. He smarted under defeat.
He got the idea that his people needed building up
physically. It was shy on brawn and muscle. At
first he had only the French in mind, but soon his
plans took in other nations too. So a big convention
of delegates met in Paris and formed an
Olympic committee that has carried on the work
ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did they hold the first meet?&rdquo; asked
Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Athens in 1896,&rdquo; answered Tom, &ldquo;and it
certainly seemed right that Greece, the scene of
the old Olympic games, should have the first
chance at the new. And everybody was glad too
to have a Greek win the first great Marathon race.
The excitable Greeks went wild over it. They
gave him all sorts of presents. Some were of
great value; others were simply comical. A
tailor gave him a suit of clothes. A barber promised
him free shaves for life. A restaurant gave
him a dinner every day for a year and another
volunteered two cups of coffee daily as long as he
lived. One laundry did his washing free and another
his ironing. Many women offered to marry
him, but he turned them all down for the little
Greek girl, his sweetheart, who had promised to
say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if he came in first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s what made him win,&rdquo; laughed
Dick.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well it didn&rsquo;t slow him up any,&rdquo; agreed Tom,
&ldquo;you may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since that time,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;they have met
in various places. We&rsquo;ve had it once in this
country, in St. Louis, in 1904. But whether held
here or abroad, your Uncle Sam has been on deck
every time. Our boys have taken twice as many
first prizes as all other nations put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a winning way we have,&rdquo; crowed Dick.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seldom far behind when the laurel crowns
are handed out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole idea is splendid, anyway,&rdquo; exclaimed
Bert. &ldquo;The men that meet in the games
learn to like and respect each other. When they
once get together they&rsquo;re surprised to find how
much they are alike in all that goes to make up a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;it helps a lot. I&rsquo;ll bet it
does more good than all the Peace societies you
hear so much about. It&rsquo;s bound to make us understand
each other better. So here&rsquo;s to the next
Olympic, especially its Marathon race, and may
the best man win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; said Tom, with a glance at Bert,
&ldquo;and I know his name.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Deadly Rattler</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The days flew by as though on wings. Reddy
brought his men along by easy stages. He
was far too wise to be impatient. He believed
in the old motto of &ldquo;hastening slowly.&rdquo; But
every day saw its quota of work mapped out and
performed, and before long his persistent effort
began to tell. The little group of athletes under
his control rounded into form, and it became certain
that the Blue colors would be carried to victory
in more than one event when it came to the
final test.</p>

<p>Upon Bert, however, he banked more heavily
than on any other. He felt that here he had an
ideal combination of brain and brawn. Nature
had given him the material to work with and it
depended entirely on the training to turn him
out in the &ldquo;pink of condition&rdquo; for the decisive
race.</p>

<p>Not once, however, did he let him run the full
Marathon distance of twenty-six miles. In his expressive
phrase it would &ldquo;take too much out of
him.&rdquo; From fifteen miles he gradually increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the distance, until on one occasion he let him run
twenty-two, and then he stopped him, although
Bert protested that he was easily good for the remaining
four.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Reddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only asking
your legs and lungs to make the twenty-two.
The last few miles will be run on your nerve anyway,
and I want you to save up every bit of that
until the day of the race. You&rsquo;ll need every ounce
of it when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Bert it was a time of stern self denial. As
he neither smoked or drank, it was no sacrifice
to be forbidden these indulgences. But the carefully
restricted diet, the cutting out of the many
things his appetite craved and had been accustomed
to, the hard and unending work required
to perfect his wind and develop his muscles called
on all his courage and determination to see the
thing through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Tom one day, when after an especially
severe practice they were walking toward
their rooms, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you stand it, Bert.
A slave in the cotton fields before the war had
nothing on you in the matter of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work certainly does seem to be my middle
name, just now,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;but the pay
comes later on. I&rsquo;ll forget all this slavery, as you
call it, if I can only flash past the line a winner.
And even if I don&rsquo;t have that luck, I&rsquo;ll have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
satisfaction of knowing that I have done my best
and gone down fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll end up fighting, sure enough,&rdquo; said
Tom emphatically, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t go down unless
you sprain an ankle or break a leg. The only
question with the boys here is not whether you will
win&mdash;they&rsquo;re dead sure of that&mdash;but whether
you&rsquo;ll hang up a new record.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There really isn&rsquo;t any such thing as a record
for the Marathon,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;The conditions
are so different in each race that no one can fairly
be compared with another. If it were simply a
matter of padding around on a flat track, you
could get at the time easily. But the roads, the
hills, the wind and the weather all come into the
account, and they&rsquo;re never just alike. The fastest
time so far is two hours and thirty-six minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day you ran twenty-two miles, Reddy
said that you were going at the rate of two hours
and twenty-five minutes for the whole distance,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s some speed, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Bert, &ldquo;and as far as feeling
went, I could have kept it up to the end. Those
last four miles though would have been the hardest
and probably the slowest. But I never cared
much about records anyhow. It&rsquo;s men that I
have to beat. Time is a thing you don&rsquo;t see or
hear and you can&rsquo;t work up much enthusiasm over
it. But when another fellow is showing you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
way or pushing you hard, then&rsquo;s the time you
really wake up. The old never-give-up feeling
comes over you and you tell yourself you&rsquo;ll win
or drop dead trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at this moment Dick ran up, waving a telegram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, old scout,&rdquo; called out Bert, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
up? You look as though you&rsquo;d got money from
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better even than that,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
just had a wire from Mr. Hollis that he&rsquo;s on his
way in the Red Scout and is going to drop in on
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Bert, and &ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; echoed Tom.
&ldquo;When&rsquo;s he going to get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some time to-morrow if nothing happens.
Say we won&rsquo;t be glad to see him, eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no need of the enthusiastic whoop
that followed. Their former Camp Master had
always held a warm place in their hearts. A
gentleman of means and culture, he had been identified
with their plans and experiences for several
years past. Under his wise and genial leadership,
they had passed some of the happiest hours
of their lives in the summer camp of which he was
the ruling spirit. His help and advice had always
been so sound and kind that they had come to look
upon him almost as an older brother. While
never indulging in the &ldquo;familiarity that breeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
contempt,&rdquo; and firm almost to sternness when that
quality was needed, they felt that he was always
looking for their best interests and making their
cause his own. And now that they were in college
he had still kept in touch with them through
letters and occasional reunions of the old summer
campers at his home.</p>

<p>A host of recollections came up before them as
they talked of his coming. They saw him as he
faced the scowling mob of gipsies who had stolen
Dick&rsquo;s watch and forced them to give up their
plunder. They recalled the glorious outing that
his thoughtfulness had planned for the orphaned
youngsters of the county town. They heard
again the crack of his pistol as he started that
memorable race between the Red Scout and the
Gray Ghost, and the delight in his face as the good
old Scout with Bert at the wheel had shown the
way to its rival over the finish line.</p>

<p>So that when they heard the familiar &ldquo;honk-honk&rdquo;
of his car the next day and saw the Red
Scout slipping swiftly up the drive under the elms,
Mr. Hollis had a royal and uproarious welcome
that &ldquo;warmed the cockles of his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, boys, remember that my hand is flesh and
blood and not Bessemer steel,&rdquo; he laughed, as they
bore him off to their rooms.</p>

<p>After the first greetings were over, he came
straight to the purpose of his visit.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran out here to kidnap you fellows,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;None of you look weak and
wasted&rdquo;&mdash;and he smiled as he looked at their
bronzed faces, glowing with health and vitality&mdash;&ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t have any idea that you&rsquo;re killing
yourself with over work. Still, a few days change
is a good thing for all of us at times. I&rsquo;m going
up to my lodge in the Adirondacks to get it ready
for my family who expect to stay there this summer.
I shan&rsquo;t be gone more than a week, and as
your mid-term vacation starts to-morrow it won&rsquo;t
interfere with your studies. It&rsquo;s a wild place
there&mdash;no neighbors, no telephones, no anything
that looks like civilization. The nearest town is
fourteen miles away and I plan to leave the Red
Scout there while we go the rest of the way on
foot. We&rsquo;ll have to rough it a little, but it&rsquo;s
a glorious bit of &lsquo;God&rsquo;s outdoors,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll guarantee
that you&rsquo;ll eat like wolves and sleep like
babies and come back kicking up your heels like
thoroughbreds. Will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Would they go! Could anything keep them
from going? But after the first wild shout of
assent, Bert&rsquo;s face fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just how Reddy will look at
it,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;You know how strict he is
about training. He may kick like the mischief
at my going out of his sight just now. I&rsquo;ll have
to put it up to him.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>So put it up to him he did, and that autocrat
promptly put his foot down hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I wonder
at your asking me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as he saw Bert&rsquo;s disappointment, he hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till I think.&rdquo; And
he fell into a brown study.</p>

<p>At length he looked up. &ldquo;I tell you straight,
Wilson,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;if it were any other fellow
on the track team, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. But
you&rsquo;ve never shirked or broken training and I&rsquo;m
going to let you go. You&rsquo;re drawn pretty fine,
just now and perhaps a few days up in the pine
woods won&rsquo;t hurt you any. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of
letting up on you a bit so that you wouldn&rsquo;t go
stale. Just at present you&rsquo;re right on edge and
fit to run for a man&rsquo;s life. Go easy on the eats
and do just enough training each day to keep in
condition. I don&rsquo;t mind if you take on five
pounds or thereabouts, so that I&rsquo;ll have that much
to work off when you get back. And turn up here
in a week from to-day as fit as a fiddle. If you
don&rsquo;t, may heaven forgive you for I won&rsquo;t. Now
go quick,&rdquo; he ended up with a twinkle in his eye,
&ldquo;before I take it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert needed no urging and rushed back to his
rooms with the good news that made his friends
jubilant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hustle&rsquo;s the word from now on,&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our things together in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they hustled to such good purpose that
within an hour their traps and outing togs were
thrown into the capacious tonneau of the Red
Scout and they piled in ready for the start.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s fingers thrilled as he grasped the wheel
and threw in the clutch. The noble car almost
seemed to recognize its driver and flew along like
a thing alive. The roofs and towers of the college
buildings faded away behind them and their
journey to the Adirondacks was begun.</p>

<p>The roads were fine and the weather superb,
and they figured that if these conditions held out
they would reach their destination the afternoon
of the following day. An ordinary car with a
mediocre driver could not have made it. But the
Red Scout had long before demonstrated its speed,
and under Bert&rsquo;s skilful handling it fairly ate up
the miles that intervened between them and their
journey&rsquo;s end. Of course they had to slow up a
little when they passed through towns, but when
the road stretched far ahead like a white ribbon
with no other vehicle in sight, Bert let her out
to the limit. If the speed laws weren&rsquo;t exactly
broken, they were at least in Tom&rsquo;s phrase
&ldquo;slightly bent.&rdquo; Occasionally Tom and Dick relieved
him while he leaned back in the tonneau
and talked with Mr. Hollis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At railroad crossings they were perhaps unduly
careful, for all remembered that awful moment
when they had been caught on the tracks and only
Bert&rsquo;s lightning calculation had saved them from
a frightful disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you ever forget,&rdquo; asked Tom, &ldquo;how the
old Scout bumped over the ties at the rate of a
mile a minute while the express train came roaring
up behind us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;More than once
I&rsquo;ve dreamed of it and lived it all over again until
I woke in a cold perspiration. Once it actually
seemed to strike and throw me up in the air, and
when I landed I almost jumped out of bed. It
gives me the creeps just to think of it, and I don&rsquo;t
want anything more of that kind in mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure was a case of touch and go,&rdquo; chimed
in Bert. &ldquo;I could feel the heat from the engine
on my neck as I bent over the wheel. Of course
we knew that the engineer was working desperately
to stop, but the question was whether he
could do it in time. If anything had given way
in the Scout, it would have been all up with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she pulled us through all right,&rdquo; said
Dick, patting the side of the car, &ldquo;like that famous
horse on his way to the battlefield:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;As though it knew the terrible need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stretched away at its utmost speed.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">But we can&rsquo;t gamble that way with death more
than once and hope to &lsquo;put it over,&rsquo; and after
this I don&rsquo;t need to have any railroad sign tell me
to &lsquo;Stop. Look. Listen.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do all three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With chat and song and laughter the hours
sped by. They were young, life ran warm in
their veins, the world lay before them full of
promise and of hope, glowing with all the colors
of the rainbow. A happier, more carefree group
it would have been hard to find in all the broad
spaces between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Had
any one told them of the awful hazard, the haunting
fear, the straining horror that they were soon
to undergo they would have laughed at him as a
false prophet of evil. The present at least was
theirs and they found it good.</p>

<p>At about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon they
reached the county town, and here they reluctantly
said good-bye for the present to the Red Scout.
The one road through the wilderness up to Mr.
Hollis&rsquo; house was a rough path to be trodden only
on foot or, at need, in one of the mountain buckboards
that could bump its way along over spots
and around stumps that might have wrecked a
machine. So after arranging for the care of the
auto, they shouldered their few bundles and set
out on foot. It was an ideal day for walking.
The sun scarcely made itself felt as it filtered
through the trees, and the balsam of the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was like a tonic. Long before dusk they reached
the lodge where a good supper awaited them, prepared
by the caretaker whom Mr. Hollis had notified
of his coming.</p>

<p>The night came on clear and almost cold in
that high mountain altitude and it was hard to
realize that men were sweltering in cities not far
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sleep under blankets to-night,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hollis, &ldquo;and in the meantime what do you say to
building a roaring camp fire right out here in the
open? It&rsquo;ll be a reminder of the old days in
camp when Dave Ferris used to spin his famous
ghost and tiger yarns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys hailed the suggestion with enthusiasm.
They speedily gathered a supply of dry branches,
enough to replenish the fire the whole evening.
Then while the flames crackled and mounted high
in the air they threw themselves around it in all
sorts of careless attitudes and gave themselves
up to unrestrained enjoyment of the time and
place. At last slumber beckoned and they turned
in.</p>

<p>They slept that night the dreamless sleep of
health and youth and woke refreshed the next
morning ready, as Tom put it, &ldquo;for anything from
pitch and toss to manslaughter.&rdquo; A plunge in a
nearby stream whetted their appetites for the
hearty breakfast that followed, and then they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
out for a stroll, while Mr. Hollis remained in the
lodge, discussing with the caretaker the approaching
visit of his family.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. The dew still
sparkled on the grass, birds sang in the trees, and
the newly risen sun flooded the landscape with
beauty. A mountain brook rippled over the
stones. Partridges drummed in the tangled
thickets, chipmunks flitted like shadows across the
mountain paths, squirrels chattered noisily in the
branches. Everywhere was life and movement,
but all the artificial noises of the town were conspicuous
by their absence. To the boys, so long
used to city life, the change was delightful beyond
words.</p>

<p>By the side of the path, about a quarter of a
mile from the lodge, was a great dogwood tree
snowy with its fragrant blooms. Tom reached
up to break off a branch, but just as he snapped
the stem it slipped through his fingers and fell
in the bushes beneath. He stooped over to pick
it up. There was a whirring sound, a rattle that
struck terror to their hearts and Tom jumped
back with a great, gray, writhing thing hanging
to his sleeve. He shook it off and staggered
backward, while the rattler instantly coiled to
strike again.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Run for Life</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Quick as lightning Bert slashed at the wicked
head with a heavy stick he had been carrying.
It caught the snake just as it darted forward and
broke its back. It fell, twisting and writhing,
and Bert throwing away his stick leaped to Tom&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he get you, Tom?&rdquo; he asked, with a
horrible fear tugging at his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Tom, trying to smile.
&ldquo;He seemed to be tangled up in my sleeve. Perhaps
his teeth didn&rsquo;t go through. But I feel&mdash;rather&mdash;queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant Dick and Bert yanked off Tom&rsquo;s
coat and rolled up his shirt sleeve. Their hearts
almost stopped beating. There, just below the
elbow were two tiny punctures, fiery red against
the white skin.</p>

<p>Like a flash Dick&rsquo;s lips were on the wound as
he strove to draw out the venom. Bert whipped
out his handkerchief and tied it tightly just above
those ominous spots. Then he thrust a stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
through the folds and twisted it until Tom grew
white with the pain.</p>

<p>Drawing his whistle from his pocket, Bert blew
loud and shrill a series of short and long notes
in the Morse alphabet that told of deadly need
and peril. He knew that if it reached the ears
of Mr. Hollis it would bring him instantly.</p>

<p>And now for a doctor. But where? He cast
wildly about him and his heart sank as he realized
that there was none nearer than the county town
fourteen miles away. Fourteen long miles over a
rough forest road. There was no telephone or
telegraph in that wilderness. The only horse on
the place was a sedate old brute who couldn&rsquo;t
be flogged into a gallop. There was one thing
to do and only one. He leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>At that moment an answering whistle came over
the hill, telling him that Mr. Hollis had heard
and was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; Bert cried to Dick. &ldquo;Keep a stiff
upper lip, old man,&rdquo; as he clapped Tom on the
shoulder. Another moment and the woods closed
round him.</p>

<p>Those giant trees, centuries old, had seen some
strange sights in their time. Perhaps in the old
days some Indian brave in pursuit of his quarry
or himself pressed hard by enemies had passed
beneath them like the flight of an arrow. But it
is doubtful if they had ever seen a white man running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
at such speed as Bert&rsquo;s, as like a young
Mercury with winged heels he rushed along under
their branches. Life was at stake&mdash;Tom&rsquo;s life,
he reflected as a pang tore through him&mdash;and he
must run as he had never run before if he were
to come out winner.</p>

<p>The road itself was a fearful handicap. It was
little more than a woodcutter&rsquo;s path, ridged by
deep furrows, dotted here and there with stumps,
strewn with branches blown down in storms. Even
where it was comparatively clear, the pine needles
that carpeted it in spots offered a slippery and
treacherous footing. Low-hanging branches
brushed his face, long creepers reached out to
grasp his flying feet. If he should once slip or
trip or sprain an ankle&mdash;. He shuddered and ran
on.</p>

<p>He had started off at a terrific pace and had
covered three miles or more at top speed. Then
the strain began to tell. His lungs were laboring
and his breath came in gasps that were almost
sobs. He took a grip on himself. At this rate
he would collapse before he had gone five miles.
He must husband his strength or he would never
reach the end of his journey. And then&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>At the thought he slackened speed and fell into
the long steady lope that yet covered the ground
at an amazing rate. His breathing became
easier and he knew that he would soon get his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
second wind. Then he felt that he could run all
day.</p>

<p>Now he had made half the distance and from
the crown of a hill he caught sight of the far-off
spire of a church that marked the location of the
town. It put new speed into his feet and life into
his veins. He would win through. He must win
through. Yet through his self assurance came at
times the terrible thought&mdash;suppose that after all
he should be too late.</p>

<p>A fierce rage against the whole snake family
took possession of him. Again he heard the
blood-curdling rattle; again he saw the malicious
eyes in which a devil lurked, the ugly triangular
head, the long slimy diamond-marked body that
turned him sick with loathing. He could have
wished that all the venomous tribe had been compressed
in one, that he might kill it with a single
blow.</p>

<p>But he shook off this feeling. Hate weakened
him&mdash;taxed too heavily his vital forces. He
must concentrate on just one thing&mdash;Tom and the
terrible need for haste.</p>

<p>Now he was running easily. His wind was
in good condition. His legs had taken on new
strength. The only danger left was the path. If
he could avoid injury that would cripple him, he
knew he could win. He had shed hat and coat
and vest, had even thrown away his knife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
whistle to lighten himself by every ounce for the
final sprint. A mountain brook lay in his path.
He stooped, dashed the water over his head and
ran on.</p>

<p>At last the woods became less dense. Scattered
clearings here and there told him he was
reaching the outskirts of the town. He passed
a farmhouse, then another. He caught a glimpse
of people at doors and windows staring at him
as though at an apparition. A team drew hastily
aside to let him pass. A straggling line of houses
marked the entrance to the town. Just as he
reached the main street, he caught sight of a
doctor&rsquo;s sign, and dashing upon the porch hammered
at the door.</p>

<p>The woman who opened it started back at the
sight of him. He was dripping with sweat, his
face was haggard and drawn, his eyes burning
with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said a tall, keen-faced man, appearing
at this moment. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between gasps Bert made known his errand.
The doctor&rsquo;s face grew grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll harness up and
be with you in a minute.&rdquo; And he hurriedly left
the room.</p>

<p>But Bert was thinking quickly. Over that
rough road and largely uphill, even a good horse&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the doctor&rsquo;s nag was not likely to be a
thoroughbred&mdash;would find it hard to negotiate the
distance within two hours. And what might happen
to Tom in that time he did not dare to think.
What could he do? And then like a flash came
the solution. The Red Scout! She could make
it in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Without a word he rushed out of the house
and across to the combination livery and garage
where the machine was stored. There it stood,
the most conspicuous object in the place, with all
trace of its journey removed and its cylinders
shining. It was the work of a moment to explain
matters to the proprietor and see that there was
plenty of gasoline in the tank. He sprang to the
driver&rsquo;s seat, threw in the clutch and glided swiftly
out to the road. So that when the doctor drove
around the side of the house he was astonished
to see the great car come swooping down upon
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, doctor,&rdquo; shouted the wild-eyed
youth at the wheel, &ldquo;come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make it,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;on this
road. You&rsquo;ll split it apart. You&rsquo;ll tear it to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will make it,&rdquo; cried Bert. &ldquo;We <i>must</i>
make it. Jump in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the doctor hesitated. He knew&mdash;none
better&mdash;the need of haste. Still his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
life was precious. Then he rose to the occasion.
His sporting blood was roused. He would take
a chance. He swung his case into the tonneau
and leaped in after it. &ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>And Bert let her go!</p>

<p>The doctor saw some &ldquo;demon driving&rdquo; that
day. The great machine sprang forward like an
arrow released from the string. The cheer that
rose from the little knot of townspeople who had
hastily collected was lost in the roar of the exhaust.
The town itself melted away like a dream.
The wind whistled past them with a shriek. In a
moment they had passed the straggling farmhouses
and entered on the road that led upwards
through the woods.</p>

<p>Crouched low over the wheel to offer as little
resistance as possible to the wind, Bert kept his
eye glued on the path ahead. To strike a tree
meant death. Collision with a stump would be
wreck and disaster. The car lunged from side
to side and the doctor, down on the floor of the
tonneau, held on for his life. Again and again
they grazed death by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth and escaped
as by a miracle. Yielding to Bert&rsquo;s slightest
touch, the Scout evaded a stump here, a gully
there, part of the time on two wheels, again on
three, but always righting in time. And all the
while, it was climbing, climbing&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Now they had covered three-fourths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
distance and his heart leaped in a wild riot of exultation.
He patted the wheel, soothed it, talked
to it as though it could understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go it, old scout,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;keep it up.
We&rsquo;ll get there yet. We&rsquo;re running for Tom.
You know Tom, good old Tom. You&rsquo;ve carried
him many a time. Now perhaps he&rsquo;s dying.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His own fierce energy seemed to impart itself
to the car. On it went until it topped the rise
of the clearing, swung into the road that led to the
lodge, and with a triumphal blast from its horn
tore up to the door. Before it had fairly stopped,
Bert leaped from his seat and the doctor stepped
down from the tonneau, his face set and drawn
from the perilous ride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hollis
appearing at the door. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dare to hope
for you for two hours yet. Come in, quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no time for further explanations, but
in the course of the fight for Tom&rsquo;s life that followed,
Bert learned of what had happened since
he had started on his run for help. Warned by
the whistle, Mr. Hollis and the caretaker had hurried
to Dick&rsquo;s side, and together they had carried
Tom to the house. They had kept the ligature
tight and had cut out the part immediately surrounding
the wound. By the greatest efforts they
had fought off the deadly coma, but, despite it all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he was fast lapsing into unconsciousness when the
doctor appeared.</p>

<p>Faced by a peril that he knew, the doctor
pulled himself together and became the cool, alert
man of science. Such cases were familiar to him
in that wild district, and there was no hesitation or
uncertainty in his treatment. His quick sharp
commands found ready obedience from his willing
helpers, and after an hour of the hardest kind
of work the fight was won. Tom&rsquo;s pulse became
more normal, his brow grew moist and he opened
his eyes and smiled faintly at the group around
him. The doctor rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The fangs
just missed the large vein, or he&rsquo;d have been done
for. As it is, we&rsquo;ve barely pulled him through.
If we&rsquo;d been an hour later, I wouldn&rsquo;t have answered
for him. We can thank this young man,&rdquo;
looking at Bert, &ldquo;for saving his friend&rsquo;s life.
By George, such driving! I&rsquo;ve never ridden so
fast before and I never want to again. A little
more of that and I&rsquo;d be a candidate myself for the
hospital or insane asylum. How we escaped being
dashed to pieces I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was great luck,&rdquo; said Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was great skill,&rdquo; ejaculated Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Providence,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis gravely,
and no one cared to dispute him.</p>

<p>After Tom was sleeping naturally and healthfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and Bert and the doctor had bathed and
dressed, they sat down to dinner. It was a quiet
meal as all were feeling the reaction from the
tremendous efforts of the morning. But their
fatigue was lost in thankfulness. They had
matched their forces against death and this time
had won. But by how narrow a margin!</p>

<p>Dinner over, they strolled down the path to the
scene of the encounter. There lay the cause of
all the trouble. The long body, as thick as a
man&rsquo;s wrist, stretched out in a wavy line across
the road. The diamond markings had dulled
somewhat, but the staring eyes still seemed lit
with malice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a holy terror!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an old-timer,
sure enough. He must be over five feet long and
eleven years old, as you can see from his rattles.
If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll take these rattles along
and hang them up in my office. They&rsquo;ll serve to
remind me of the most stirring incident in my life
so far,&rdquo; and he smiled, mischievously, at Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them and welcome as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo;
said Bert. &ldquo;For my part I never want
to see another snake, living or dead, for the rest
of my natural life.&rdquo; And as every one else felt
the same way, the doctor neatly severed the grisly
memento, to be duly dried and mounted in his
sanctum.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Bert offered to take the doctor back to town
in the auto, but the others put in an emphatic
veto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollis. &ldquo;Not another
thing for you to-day but rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; echoed Dick. &ldquo;Even
Reddy, tyrant that he is, would agree that you&rsquo;d
had exercise enough for one day. I&rsquo;ll take the
doctor down myself. He won&rsquo;t go back as fast
as he came up, but he&rsquo;ll be more comfortable. I
always look out for the safety of <i>my</i> passengers,&rdquo;
he added, with mock severity.</p>

<p>The doctor grinned appreciatively. &ldquo;Slow
down to a walk as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;My appetite for speed has been satisfied for a
long time to come. Any more just now would
give me indigestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick&rsquo;s plan was to put the Red Scout in the
garage, stay at the hotel that night and walk back
in the morning. But the doctor who had taken a
great liking to these young specimens of manhood
overruled this, and insisted so strongly that Dick
should be his guest over night that this was finally
agreed upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you back in the buckboard,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;when I come up to-morrow to see how our patient
is getting along. In the meantime, don&rsquo;t
worry. The worst is over and it&rsquo;s only a matter
of careful nursing for the next few days and he&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
be on his feet again. His youth and vitality and
clean life, together with the &lsquo;first aid&rsquo; you gave
him have pulled him through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to mention the doctor and Bert and the
&lsquo;Red Scout,&rsquo;&rdquo; added Mr. Hollis.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed and stepped into the machine.
Dick took the wheel and the splendid car,
none the worse for its wild ride, started on its
way back to town, while Bert and Mr. Hollis,
standing on the porch, looked after it almost as
affectionately as though it had been human.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tally one more for the good old Scout,&rdquo; murmured
Bert, as he turned away.</p>

<p>That evening, his face still flushed at the heartfelt
praise of his host, Bert went in to bid Tom
good-night. The patient was getting on famously,
but the shock to his system still persisted and he
had been forbidden to do much talking. But the
pressure of his hand on Bert&rsquo;s and the look in
his eyes were eloquent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Bert,&rdquo; he half whispered,
&ldquo;what Reddy said the last time you saw him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; answered Bert, puzzled, and cudgeling
his memory, &ldquo;nothing special. What did
he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fit to run for a man&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Desperate Struggle</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Tom mended fast, though not in time to go
back with Bert and Dick, and Mr. Hollis
insisted that he should stay a week or ten days
longer at the lodge until he had fully recovered.</p>

<p>The precious week of vacation passed only too
quickly, and promptly on the day that college resumed,
Bert, faithful to his promise, was back at
work. He had carefully kept up his practice, and
this, combined with the invigorating mountain air,
had put him in splendid shape. As he confided to
Dick, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;d felt any better he&rsquo;d have been
afraid of himself.&rdquo; So that when he reported to
Reddy and submitted to his inspection, even that
austere critic could find no fault with the sinewy
athlete who smilingly extended his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers,&rdquo; he said, as he looked him
up and down approvingly, &ldquo;I did a good thing to
let you go. You&rsquo;re fine as silk and trained to the
hour. If looks count for anything you could go
in now and break the record. Get out on the
cinder path and let me time you for a five-mile
spin.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>With the eye of a lynx, he noted Bert&rsquo;s action
as he circled the track. Nothing escaped him.
The erect carriage, the arms held close to his
sides, the hip and knee movement, the feet scarcely
lifted from the ground, the long, easy stride that
fairly ate up space, the dilated nostrils through
which he breathed while keeping the mouth firmly
closed, the broad chest that rose and fell with no
sign of strain or labor&mdash;above all, the sense of
reserve power that told of resources held back
until the supreme moment called for them&mdash;all
these marks of the born runner the trainer noted
with keen satisfaction; and he was chuckling to
himself when he snapped shut his split-second
watch and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to break a leg to lose,&rdquo; he gloated.
&ldquo;That lad is in a class by himself. I&rsquo;m none too
sure of the other events, but we sure have this
one cinched. We&rsquo;ll win in a walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while he thus communed with himself, he
carefully abstained from saying as much to Bert.
He had seen too many promising athletes ruined
by overconfidence. Besides, while he felt sure that
Bert could take the measure of any one now
known to him as a runner, he couldn&rsquo;t tell but
what some &ldquo;dark horse&rdquo; would be uncovered at
the general meet who would bring all his hopes
tumbling about his head like a house of cards.
Too many &ldquo;good things&rdquo; had gone wrong in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
experience not to make him cautious. So it was
with well-simulated indifference that he held up
his hand at the end of the fifth mile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for to-day,&rdquo; he commanded.
&ldquo;To-morrow we&rsquo;ll start in with the real work.
We only have a scant two weeks left before the
New York meet and we&rsquo;ll need every minute of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bert bent himself to his task with such
earnestness and good will that when at last the
great day of the final meet arrived he was at the
top of his form. Neither he nor Reddy would
have any excuses to offer or anything to reproach
themselves with, if he failed to show his heels to
the field.</p>

<p>And, as Dick remarked, when they entered the
gate of the mammoth park, it &ldquo;was certainly
some field.&rdquo; From every section of the country
they had gathered&mdash;burly giants from the Pacific
slope, the slenderer greyhound type of the East&mdash;some
from colleges, others wearing the badge of
famous athletic clubs&mdash;all of them in superb condition
and all passionately bent on winning. To
carry off a trophy in such company was a distinction
to be prized. And, in addition to the ordinary
incentives, was the international character of
the event. Before the eyes of each hung the lure
of a European trip and the opportunity of proving
on foreign fields that the picked athletes of America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
could lead the world. Patriotism was blended
with personal ambition and they formed a powerful
combination.</p>

<p>Moreover, the chances of being chosen were
much greater than is usual in such contests. Not
only the winner in each event was to make the
trip, but the man who came in second or third or
even farther down the list would go. The Committee
was not going to &ldquo;put all its eggs in one
basket.&rdquo; The chances of sickness or accident or
change of climate were too many to justify them
in depending upon a single competitor to carry the
colors of his country in any given struggle. Thus
in the pole vaulting, hammer throwing, swimming,
hurdling, javelin casting, there would be from
three to six competitors each. In the Marathon&mdash;most
important of all&mdash;as many as a dozen would
probably be taken. So that all were buoyed up
by the hope that even if some luckier or better
man carried off first honors to-day, they still might
be of the elect, if they were well up at the finish.</p>

<p>It was a striking and animated scene that the
great park presented. A famous regimental band
played national airs and &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo; floated
proudly over the judges&rsquo; pavilion. The stands
were packed with a vast multitude that overflowed
on the lawns, while on the inner track groups of
contenders indulged in preliminary practice and
loosened up their muscles before the games began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Then the bell rang, the tracks were cleared and
the throng settled down to watch the performance
of their favorites.</p>

<p>Fortune was kind to the Blues that day and
their number was hoisted more than once on the
bulletin board. Burly Drake cast the discus one
hundred and thirty-four feet. Axtell won the
standing broad jump and set the mark at eleven
feet, two inches. Hinchman was second in the
half-mile, and Martin cleared the pole at a height
of twelve feet, one inch. Bert and Dick exulted
at the showing of their Alma Mater and Reddy
tried in vain to conceal his delight under a mask
of grim indifference.</p>

<p>At last the time came for the Marathon.
Eighteen miles was to be the limit, as the Committee
agreed with Reddy that the actual Marathon
distance might well be deferred until the day
of the actual race. It was a fair presumption that
those who showed up best at the end of the eighteen
miles would be best prepared to cover the full
distance of twenty-six when they had to face that
heart-breaking test.</p>

<p>A final rub-down and Bert was ready. A last
slap on the shoulder from Dick, a word of caution
from Reddy, a howl of welcome from the Blues
as he came in sight, and he trotted to the starting
line where forty more were gathered. He threw
off his sweater, and clad only in his light tunic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and running trunks, with a blue sash about his
waist, faced the starter. Like a young Viking
he stood there, lithe and alert, in his eye the light
of combat, in his veins the blood of youth, in his
heart the hope of triumph.</p>

<p>A moment&rsquo;s breathless pause. Then the pistol
cracked and they were off.</p>

<p>As they rushed in a compact body past the
stand, a tremendous roar of greeting and encouragement
nerved them to the struggle. In a twinkling
they were rounding the first turn and the
race was fairly on.</p>

<p>They had not gone a mile before Bert knew
that he had his work cut out for him. It was not
that there was any phenomenal burst of speed
that tended to take him off his feet. At this he
would merely have smiled at that stage of the
game. Sprinting just then would have been suicidal.
But it was rather the air of tension, of grim
determination, of subtle craftiness that made itself
felt as in none of his previous races. Many of
these men, especially the members of the athletic
clubs, were veterans who had competed at a score
of meets, while he was a comparative novice.
They knew every trick of the racing game. Their
judgment of pace, based on long experience, was
such that without the aid of a watch they could
tell within a few seconds the time of every mile
they made. Hard as nails, holders of records,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
intent of purpose, they might well inspire respect
and fear.</p>

<p>Respect&mdash;yes. Fear&mdash;no. There flashed across
Bert&rsquo;s mind a quaint saying of Reddy&rsquo;s about
pugilists: &ldquo;The bigger they are the harder they
fall.&rdquo; And he ran on.</p>

<p>Gradually the group spread out like a fan.
None had quit, for it was any one&rsquo;s race so far.
But stamina and speed were beginning to tell.
That indefinable something called &ldquo;class&rdquo; made
itself felt. Some were faltering in their stride,
others laboring heavily for breath. Sometimes
the laggards made despairing sprints that partly
closed the gap between them and the leaders, but,
unable to maintain the pace, fell back again to the
ruck.</p>

<p>Running easily and keeping himself well in
hand, Bert at the end of the twelfth mile was
bunched with five others up in front. He knew
now whom he had to beat. Thornton was at his
left, and Brady a little in front. But these did
not worry him. Magnificent runners as they were,
he felt that he had their measure. He had beaten
them once and could do it again.</p>

<p>On his right was a little Irishman with a four-leaved
clover&mdash;the emblem of his club&mdash;embroidered
on his sleeve. Behind him pounded two
others, like wolves on the flank of a deer. One
of them was an Indian runner from Carlisle, tall
and gaunt, with an impassive face. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
bore the winged-foot emblem that told of membership
in the most famous athletic club in the
East.</p>

<p>Mile after mile passed, and still they hung on.
The little Irishman was wabbling, but still fighting
gamely. Brady had &ldquo;bellows to mend.&rdquo; Bert
could hear his breath coming in long, hoarse
gasps that told of strength rapidly failing.
The Indian had ranged alongside, going strong.
Behind him still padded the feet of the remaining
runner.</p>

<p>At the sixteenth mile, Bert quickened his pace
and called on his reserve. His heart was thumping
like a trip-hammer and his legs were weary,
but his wind was good. He left the Irishman behind
him and was passing Brady, when the latter
swerved from sheer fatigue right in Bert&rsquo;s path
and they went down in a heap.</p>

<p>A groan burst from the Blue partisans at the
accident. Dick hid his face in his hands and
Reddy danced up and down and said things that
the recording angel, it is to be hoped, omitted to
set down, in view of the provocation.</p>

<p>Dazed and bruised, Bert struggled to his feet.
He was not seriously hurt, but badly shaken. He
looked about and then the full extent of the calamity
burst upon him.</p>

<p>The downfall had acted on the other runners
like an electric shock. Thornton and the Irishman
were two hundred feet in front, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Indian and he of the winged-foot, running neck
and neck, had opened up a gap of five hundred
feet.</p>

<p>Had it been earlier in the race he would still
have had a chance. But now with only a mile and
a half to go, the accident threatened to be fatal
to his hopes. The others had gained new life
from this unexpected stroke of luck, and it was
certain that they would not easily let go their
advantage. To win now would be almost a miracle.</p>

<p>With savage resolution he pulled himself together.
His dizzy brain cleared. Never for a
second did he think of quitting. Disaster spurred
him on to greater efforts. The Blues roared their
delight as they saw their champion start out to
overtake the flyers, now so far in front, and even
the followers of the other candidates joined generously
in the applause. A crowd loves pluck and
here was a fellow who was game to the very
core of him.</p>

<p>Link by link he let himself out. The track
slipped away beneath him. The stands were a
mere blur of color. At the turn into the last
mile he passed the nervy little Irishman, and a
quarter of a mile further on he collared Thornton.
Foot by foot he gained on the two others.
At the half, he ranged alongside the Indian who
was swaying drunkenly from side to side, killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
off by the terrific pace. Only one was left now,
but he was running like the wind.</p>

<p>Now Bert threw away discretion. He summoned
every ounce of grit and strength that he
possessed. With great leaps he overhauled his
adversary. Down they came toward the crowded
stands, fighting for the lead. The Blues tried to
sing, but in their excitement they could only yell.
The crowd went crazy. All were on their feet,
bending far over to watch the desperate struggle.
On they came to the line, first one, then the other,
showing a foot in front. Within ten feet of the
line Bert gathered himself in one savage bound,
hurled himself against the tape and fell in the
arms of his exulting mates. He had won by
inches.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Floating Race-Track</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Just what followed Bert never clearly remembered.
A hurricane of cheers, a sea of spectators,
Dick&rsquo;s face white as chalk, Reddy&rsquo;s like a
flame of fire. Then the jubilant trainer thrust a
way through the howling mob and led him to his
dressing room. An immense fatigue was on him.
His heart wanted to come out of his body and his
legs weighed a ton. But deep down in his consciousness
was a measureless content. He had
won. Again the dear old college had pinned its
faith to him and again her colors had been the
first to cross the line.</p>

<p>A long cooling-out process followed, and then
came the bath and rub-down. The strain had been
enormous, but his vitality reacted quickly, and
under Reddy&rsquo;s skillful ministrations he was soon
himself again.</p>

<p>It was a jolly party that took the special train
of the Blues back to college. More than their
share of the events had fallen to them. Drake,
Axtell, Hinchman, Martin and Bert were the center
of a hilarious group, who kept demanding at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
short intervals &ldquo;who was all right&rdquo; and answering
the questions themselves by shouting the names
of their victorious athletes. Not since that memorable
day when Bert&rsquo;s fadeaway ball had won
the pennant had their cup of satisfaction been so
full to overflowing.</p>

<p>The lion&rsquo;s share of the applause naturally fell
to Bert, not only because the Marathon was more
important than any other feature, but on account
of the accident that had come so near to ruining
his hopes and which he had so gallantly retrieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, Bert,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how
I felt when I saw you go down in that mix-up.
Just when you were getting ready to make your
run, too. I&rsquo;d been studying your gait right along
and I knew by the way you were going that you
had plenty in reserve. I was counting the race
already won. But when you went into that tangle
of legs and arms, I figured that it was all up with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so myself,&rdquo; answered Bert, &ldquo;that
is, as soon as I could think anything. At first my
head went round like a top, and for a second or
two I didn&rsquo;t know where I was. Then I saw the
heels of the fellows way up in front and I made
up my mind that they should see mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they did all right,&rdquo; chuckled Drake,
&ldquo;but it was a hundred to one shot that they
wouldn&rsquo;t. That run of yours was the pluckiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thing I ever saw, as well as the speediest. Like
the &lsquo;Charge of the Light Brigade,&rsquo; it sure was a
forlorn hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like baseball. The
game&rsquo;s never over until the last man is out in the
ninth inning, no matter how far the other fellows
may be ahead. As it was, I only got there by the
narrowest of squeaks. That winged-foot fellow
put up a nervy fight. By the way, how is Brady?
I hope he wasn&rsquo;t hurt by the tumble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered Axtell. &ldquo;He
scraped a big patch of skin off his thigh, but he
came staggering along and finished among the
first ten. The showing he made was good enough
to guarantee that he&rsquo;ll be taken along with the
rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just then Reddy the tyrant&mdash;a very good-natured
tyrant at present&mdash;intervened, and although
they protested that they were too excited
to sleep, shooed them off to their berths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the marines,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
be asleep before your head fairly touches the pillow.&rdquo;
And, as usual in things physical, Reddy
was right.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were exceedingly busy ones.
Examinations were coming on and Bert was up
to his eyes in work. He had never let sport interfere
with his studies and his standing in the class
room had been as high as his reputation on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
track. Then there were the countless odds and
ends to be attended to that always accumulate at
the end of the college year. Every day, without
fail, Reddy put him through his paces, having in
mind the forthcoming ocean voyage when regular
training would be difficult and limited.</p>

<p>Tom in the meantime had returned, still bearing
some traces of his terrible ordeal in the mountains.
The poison had been eliminated from his
system, thanks to the doctor&rsquo;s skill and the careful
oversight of Mr. Hollis, but he was not yet
his former self. It had been decided that a sea
trip was the one thing needed to bring about his
entire restoration to health. Dick had no such
excuse, but he had put it up to his parents with
so much force that he simply <i>must</i> see the Olympics
that they had at last consented. By dint of
much correspondence and influence exerted in the
right quarters, they had been able to arrange for
passage on the same steamer that was to convey
Bert and the rest of the Olympic team. So that
the &ldquo;Three Guardsmen,&rdquo; as they had been dubbed
because they were always together, rejoiced at
the prospect of a summer abroad under these rare
conditions. And there were no happier young fellows
than they in America on that memorable day
when they went over the gang-plank of the
steamer that was to carry them and their fortunes.</p>

<p>The <i>Northland</i> had been specially chartered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for the occasion. The contestants alone numbered
nearly two hundred, and when to these were added
trainers, rubbers, reporters, officials and favored
friends, this figure was more than doubled. The
Olympic Committee had done things in lavish
style, and the funds contributed by lovers of sport
all over the country had given them abundance of
means. They had learned from previous experience
the disadvantages of having the athletes go
over on the regular liners. The rich food of the
ship&rsquo;s tables, the formality that had to be observed,
the class distinctions of first, second and
third cabins and the difficulty of keeping in condition
had wrecked or lessened the chances of more
than one promising candidate.</p>

<p>Now, with the vessel absolutely under their
own control, subject of course to the captain and
officers, all these troubles disappeared. There
were no cabin distinctions and all were on the
same level. The food, while of course of the
very best quality and wholesome and abundant,
was prepared with a special view to the needs
of the athletes. There was no fixed schedule for
the trip, and therefore no danger of overspeeding
in order to reach port on time. Snobbishness and
pretense were altogether absent. All were enthusiasts
on athletics, all keenly interested in the coming
games, and the healthy freemasonry of sport
welded them into one great family. The boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had not been on board an hour before they felt
perfectly at home. At every turn they met some
one whom they knew more or less well from
having already met them in competition. There
was Brady and Thornton and Casey, the little
Irishman; and even the Indian, who had given
Bert so much trouble to beat him, so far unbent
from his usual gravity as to grin a welcome to his
conqueror. The winged-foot man, Hallowell,
shook hands cordially with a grip that bore no
malice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best man won that day,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m from Missouri and you&rsquo;ll have to show me
that you can do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your turn next,&rdquo; laughed Bert. &ldquo;That was
simply my lucky day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think next time,&rdquo; continued Hallowell, &ldquo;in
addition to the winged-foot emblem, I&rsquo;d better
carry a rabbit&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t handicap me that way,&rdquo; said Bert, in
mock alarm. &ldquo;Why rob me altogether of hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded Hallowell, &ldquo;as long as
America wins, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much which one
of us &lsquo;brings home the bacon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; rejoined Bert, heartily.</p>

<p>And this spirit prevailed everywhere. Rivalry
was keen, but it was not bitter. There was no
malice or meanness about it. Each could admire
and applaud the prowess of a rival. Naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
every one wanted to win, but above the personal
feeling rose the national. As long as America
won, nothing else mattered very much. &ldquo;Old
Glory&rdquo; floated from the stem and stern of the
great steamer. It floated also in their hearts.</p>

<p>The <i>Northland</i> had been put in the Committee&rsquo;s
hands some weeks previous to the time of sailing,
and in that brief period they had worked wonders.
The ship had been transformed into an
immense gymnasium. It was intended that regular
practice should be indulged in every day of
the trip when the weather permitted. Of course,
as &ldquo;all signs fail in dry weather,&rdquo; so all exercise
would have to be suspended in stormy weather.
But at that time of the year storms were infrequent
on the Atlantic, and it was probable that
there would be little loss of time on that account.</p>

<p>On the upper deck the Committee had built a
cork track three hundred feet long and wide
enough for two men to run abreast. This was
for the use chiefly of the sprinters, although all
found it valuable for limbering up, and even the
milers and long-distance men could use it to advantage.
The deck itself was a fifth of a mile
in circumference and here the Marathon men took
their practice. It was planned that there should
be two sessions every day, the first at ten in
the morning and the second at three in the afternoon.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But running was not allowed to eclipse the
other features. The rifle and revolver men had
a special gallery where they practised steadily.
The bicycle team were provided with machines
lashed securely to the stanchions of the vessel.
Here they pedaled away religiously, working
like beavers yet never getting anywhere. But
the practice itself was almost as good as though
the miles were actually spinning away behind them.
The tennis men had a backstop ten feet high and
an imaginary court where they practiced what
strokes they could. The fencing team had not
been overlooked, and especially well-lighted
quarters had been assigned to them.</p>

<p>For the swimmers there was a canvas tank,
replenished daily, fifteen feet long and five wide.
A belt about the swimmer&rsquo;s waist was tied to a
rope above that held him in the center of the
tank. So that while, like the bicycle team, getting
nowhere, they could yet go through the motions
and keep in perfect condition.</p>

<p>The throwers of the discus and the hammer
were naturally at some disadvantage. There
was not enough open space anywhere in the ship
for them to try out their specialties. But they
were not to be wholly denied. A section of the
rail at the stern of the ship was removed, and
fastening the discus or hammer to a rope, they
cast it out over the waves as far as they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and then drew it back, repeating the feat as often
as their trainers deemed best.</p>

<p>Then, in addition to these special arrangements,
there were the general ones in which all
took part, such as chinning the bar, skipping the
rope and passing the medicine ball. The entire
schedule was a tribute to the ingenuity and thoroughness
of the Committee. In the period devoted
to practice every chink of time was filled
up and, as Dick put it, &ldquo;no guilty minute was
permitted to escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But work had no terrors for these husky youth.
It was by dint of hard work that they had reached
their present position in the athletic world, and
now, with the greatest possible prize in view, they
were in no mood to let up. Some, in fact, had
been worrying over the prospect of a break in
training during the voyage and they were delighted
to find that their fears were groundless.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that no one ship since the
world began had carried so much brawn and
skill and speed as did the <i>Northland</i>. It carried
more&mdash;the faith and hope and pride of the American
people. And when, the next day, with
whistles blowing and flags flying and bands playing
and crowds cheering, she passed down the bay
and stood out to sea, none doubted that the
bronzed athletes she bore would return crowned
with the laurels of victory.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Off for the Fight</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The boys stood leaning on the rail as the
stately steamer passed through the vast
array of shipping on either side of the river,
slipped by the colossal figure of Liberty and,
bidding farewell to the Sandy Hook lightship,
breasted the waves of the Atlantic. They were
ardent patriots, and, as the irregular skyline of
the great city faded from their view, they felt the
pang that always comes to one on leaving his
native land. But in the &ldquo;bright lexicon of
youth&rdquo; there&rsquo;s no such word as melancholy, and
as they thought of all that lay before them their
hearts swelled with anticipation. Adventure
beckoned them, glory tempted them, hope inspired
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting out with colors flying,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping we come back the same
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;ll be the first fizzle,&rdquo; said Bert.
&ldquo;This is the fourth time Uncle Sam has sent his
boys abroad and they&rsquo;ve never yet come back
empty-handed.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve never had to
slink back and spend the rest of their lives explaining
why they didn&rsquo;t win. It has always been
the glad hand and the big eats and the brass
bands and the procession down Broadway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see Bert already sitting in one of the
swell buzz-wagons with the Marathon prize
alongside of him and trying to look unconcerned,&rdquo;
chaffed Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got good eyesight,&rdquo; retorted Bert,
drily. &ldquo;I may be only one of the &lsquo;also rans.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such shrinking modesty,&rdquo; mocked Tom.
&ldquo;Tell that to the King of Denmark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of kings,&rdquo; went on Dick, &ldquo;I suppose
we&rsquo;ll see plenty of them on the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;There were
several of them at the last games. As for princes
and dukes, they&rsquo;ll be thick as blackberries. Perhaps
we ought to be overwhelmed at the prospect
of seeing so many high mightinesses, but somehow
I can&rsquo;t get much worked up over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither can I,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
haven&rsquo;t much more reverence than the old sailor
on an American ship that was being inspected by
a lot of royalties. He came up to the captain
and touched his cap. &lsquo;Beggin&rsquo; your pardon, capting,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;but one of them there kings has
fell down the hatchway.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Bert, when the laugh had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
subsided, &ldquo;some of &lsquo;them there kings&rsquo; are pretty
decent fellows, after all. The German Emperor,
for instance, is all right. Nobody in Germany
works harder than he does. He&rsquo;s always on the
job and even if we don&rsquo;t agree with his views we
have to hand it to him. He&rsquo;s the biggest figure
in Europe to-day. I like him because he isn&rsquo;t a
mere figurehead like the rest of them. He throws
himself right into the game and he&rsquo;s there all the
time from start to finish. He&rsquo;s taking a lot of
interest in the Olympics and I hear he&rsquo;s going to
open them in person. And no doubt he&rsquo;ll be the
one to give out the prizes at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he does he&rsquo;ll have a chance to shake
hands with quite a bunch of American sovereigns,&rdquo;
said Dick, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;ll surely be a big
raft of them up there standing in line when the
trophies are handed out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Germans are certainly making great
preparations for the games,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I
hear that the stadium at Berlin is going to be the
biggest thing in that line that ever happened.
They dedicated it the other day and all Berlin
turned out to see it. The Kaiser himself was
there and made a speech, and just as he got
through they released thirty thousand doves who
flew in a great white cloud over the field. Rather
artistic idea you see&mdash;&lsquo;the dove of peace,&rsquo; and
all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea is all right,&rdquo; rejoined Dick, cynically,
&ldquo;and yet you notice that England keeps
building dreadnoughts, and France is increasing
her term of service from two years to three, and
Germany herself this year is raising an extra billion
of marks for new troops. The ideas don&rsquo;t
jibe very well, do they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented Bert. &ldquo;When I hear them
talk of doing away with war altogether, I think
of that saying of Mark Twain&rsquo;s that &lsquo;the day
may come when the lion and the lamb will lie
down together, but the lamb will be inside.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything that suggests eating,&rdquo;
chimed in Tom, &ldquo;for this sea air is making
me feel already as though I were starving to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your normal state, anyway,&rdquo; laughed
Dick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to put it off on the air. But
there goes the steward&rsquo;s gong now. Let&rsquo;s go
down and see what kind of a training table they
set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very good table they found it to be, despite
the absence of luxuries that are usually to be
found on ocean liners. Wines and liquors of all
kinds were banished, together with rich pastries
and many kinds of starchy foods. But there was
a royal abundance of meats and fruit desserts
that made them forget the absence of the richer
indigestibles. And the way the food melted away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
before the onslaught of these trained athletes
made the stewards gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us eat, drink and be merry,&rdquo; quoted
Drake, &ldquo;for to-morrow we get seasick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell that to able-bodied sailors like us,&rdquo;
retorted Dick. &ldquo;We got our sea legs long ago
on the Pacific. After the typhoon we went
through off the Japanese coast, I don&rsquo;t think that
any shindig the Atlantic can kick up will worry
us much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re lucky in having served your
apprenticeship,&rdquo; returned Drake, &ldquo;but for lots
of the fellows this is their first trip and it&rsquo;s a
pretty safe bet that there won&rsquo;t be as many at
the dinner table to-morrow as there are to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think it will bother them,&rdquo; said
Bert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fellows with a paunch who have
been living high that usually pay the penalty when
they tackle a sea trip. Our boys are in such splendid
shape that it probably won&rsquo;t upset them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After dinner they made the round of the ship.
Training was not to start until the next morning,
and the rest of the day was theirs to do with as
they liked.</p>

<p>As compared with the <i>Fearless</i>, the steamer on
which they had made the voyage to China, the
<i>Northland</i> was a giant. Apart from the splendid
athletic equipment that made it unique, it ranked
with the finest of the Atlantic liners. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
prow towered forty feet above the water. The
ship was over seven hundred feet in length and
nearly eighty feet wide. Great decks towered one
above the other until it resembled a skyscraper.
She was driven by powerful double screw engines
of the latest type that could develop thirty-six
thousand horsepower and were good for over
twenty knots an hour. The saloons and cabins
were the last word in ocean luxury. Ample provision
had been made for safety. There were
enough lifeboats and collapsible rafts, including
two motor boats, to take care of every one of the
passengers and crew in case of need. The lesson
of the <i>Titanic</i> disaster had not been forgotten,
and there was a double hull extending the whole
length of the ship, so that if one were ripped
open the other would probably be left intact.
There were thirty-two water-tight compartments
divided by steel bulkheads that could be closed in
an instant by pressing a button either from the
bridge or the engine room. The bridge itself
was eighty feet above sea level, and it made the
boys dizzy to look down at the great swells that
slipped away smoothly on either side of the prow.
Her length enabled her to cut into three waves
at once so that the tossing motion was hardly
perceptible. She rode the waters like a veritable
queen of the sea. Her captain was a grizzled old
veteran, who had been thirty years in the company&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
employ and enjoyed their fullest confidence.</p>

<p>To the eager boys, always on the lookout for
new impressions, their exploration of the ship
was of the keenest interest. They were constantly
coming across something novel. Their
previous trip on the <i>Fearless</i>, when Bert had
been the wireless operator, had of course made
them familiar with most things pertaining to a
ship. But the <i>Fearless</i> had been designed chiefly
as a trading craft and the passenger feature had
been merely an incident. Here it was the main
thing and as each new fad and wrinkle came to
their attention it awoke exclamations of wonder
and approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the real thing in boats,&rdquo; declared Dick,
emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; echoed Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
brought right up to the minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting a pretty nifty sea education,&rdquo;
remarked Bert. &ldquo;By the time we get through
this cruise, we ought to know a lot about the two
greatest oceans in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dick; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll only be the two
Arctics and the Indian Ocean left. The Arctics
I don&rsquo;t hanker after. There&rsquo;s too much cold for
yours truly, and seal meat and whale blubber
don&rsquo;t appeal to me as a steady diet. The Indian,
on the other hand, is too hot, but after some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
those days on the Pacific when the pitch fairly
started out of the deck seams, I guess we could
stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if we never get any more sea life than
what we&rsquo;re having, we&rsquo;ll be way above the average,&rdquo;
said Bert. &ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s get down to
the wireless room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here Bert felt thoroughly at home. All
the old days came back to him as he looked
around at the wireless apparatus and saw the
blue flames spitting from the sounder, as the
operator sat at the key, sending and receiving
messages from the home land that was so rapidly
being left behind. Again he heard the appeal
of the <i>Caledonian</i>, on fire from stem to
stern, as her despairing call came through the
night. Once more he was sending messages of
cheer and hope to the battered liner whirling
about in the grip of the typhoon. And, most
thrilling of all, was the memory of that savage
fight with the Chinese pirates when the current
from the dynamo had shot its swift death into
the yelling hordes just when their triumph seemed
assured. What a miracle it all was, anyway&mdash;this
mysterious force that linked the continents
together&mdash;that brought hope to the despairing,
comfort to the comfortless, life to the dying&mdash;this
greatest of man&rsquo;s discoveries that seemed almost
to border on the supernatural!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The operator then on duty&mdash;one of three who
worked in shifts of eight hours each, so that
never for a moment of day or night was the key
deserted&mdash;a bright, keen young fellow, but little
older than the boys themselves, was pleased at
their intelligent interest in his work, and, in the
intervals between messages, fell into conversation
with them and rapidly became chummy.
When he learned that Bert himself was one of
the craft, he suggested that he try his hand at
sending and receiving a few, while he sat by and
rested up. Bert assented with alacrity, and the
little smile of good-natured patronage with which
he watched him quickly changed to one of amazement,
as he saw the swiftness and dexterity with
which Bert handled the messages. Especially
was he struck by the facility which he displayed
at writing down the Marconigrams with his left
hand while keeping the right on the key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
dandy. That two-handed stunt is a new one on
me. It would make my work twice as fast and
twice as easy if I could do it. Where did you
get the idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Nature&rsquo;s responsible for that,&rdquo; laughed
Bert. &ldquo;When I was a kid I found it was almost
as easy for me to use my left hand as my right,
and I fell into the habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty good habit all right and don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you forget it,&rdquo; said the operator, emphatically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get it myself. If I do, I
may be able to hit the company for a raise in
salary,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping you get it,&rdquo; replied Bert, and
after a little more talk and a cordial invitation to
drop in whenever they could, the boys went out
in the open.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened as night came on and
the waves were running high, but the <i>Northland</i>
was as &ldquo;steady as a church.&rdquo; After supper there
was a concert in the great saloon and there was
no dearth of talent. Some of the fellows were
members of mandolin and banjo clubs and had
brought their instruments along. Others had fine
bass and tenor voices, and glee clubs were improvised.
The amateur theatrical contingent was
not lacking, and, what with song and sketch and
music, the evening passed all too rapidly. The
trainers, however, who never let pleasure interfere
with business, came now to the fore and
packed the boys off to their staterooms to have a
good night&rsquo;s rest before real work began on the
morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, the next morning, as, after
a hearty breakfast, he sat on the edge of his
berth, getting into his running togs, &ldquo;here comes
one more new experience. There&rsquo;s certainly
nothing monotonous about the racing game. I&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
run up hill and down, I&rsquo;ve run through the woods,
I&rsquo;ve run on the cinder paths, I&rsquo;ve run round the
bases, and, when the savages chased us last year,
I ran for my life. Now I&rsquo;m to run on a ship&rsquo;s
deck. I&rsquo;ll bet there isn&rsquo;t any kind of running I
haven&rsquo;t done. I&rsquo;ve even run an automobile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Dick, flippantly,
&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t run up a board bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; added Tom, &ldquo;and you haven&rsquo;t run for
office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A well-aimed pillow that made him duck ended
these outrages on the English language, and, as
Reddy poked his head in just then to summon his
charge, they tumbled up on deck.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Marathon</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, as he looked
about him. &ldquo;I wish we had a moving picture
machine on board. This would make a
dandy film.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was certainly motion enough to satisfy
the most ardent advocate of the &ldquo;strenuous life.&rdquo;
The deck was humming with life at its fullest.
Two hundred young athletes in their picturesque
costumes were working away as though their
lives depended on it. Here a swimmer splashed
in the tank and ran the gamut of all the strokes&mdash;the
&ldquo;side,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sneak,&rdquo; the &ldquo;crawl,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;trudgeon.&rdquo; From the fencers&rsquo; quarters came
the clash of steel on steel, as they thrust and
parried, now retreating, now advancing, seeking
to touch with the buttoned point the spot that
marked their opponent&rsquo;s heart. The bark of the
revolver and the more pronounced crack of the
rifle bespoke the effort of the marksmen to round
into form. Drake at the stern was striving to
outdo his rivals in casting the discus far behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ship. On the cork track the hundred-yard men
were flashing like meteors from end to end, while
the milers and long-distance men circled the ship
at ten laps to the mile. The trainers snapped the
watches on the trial heats and strove to correct
defects of form or pace. Everywhere was speed
and energy and abounding life. It was a fine
example of the spirit that has made America
great&mdash;the careful preparation, the unwearied
application, the deadly determination that simply
refuses to lose when it has once entered upon a
struggle. And Bert&rsquo;s heart bounded as he realized
that he was one of this splendid band chosen
to uphold the honor of the flag. The thought
added wings to his feet as he flew again and again
around the track, and he might have prolonged
the trial far beyond the point of prudence had it
not been for the restraining hand of Reddy. That
foxy individual never let his sporting blood&mdash;and
he had aplenty&mdash;run away with his common
sense. He knew when to apply the brake as well
as the spur, and on this first day under the novel
conditions the brake was the more important. So,
long before Bert would have stopped of his own
accord and while he was reeling off the miles with
no sense of exhaustion, Reddy called a halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough is plenty,&rdquo; said he, in answer to
Bert&rsquo;s protestations that he had just begun to run.
&ldquo;Even if the ship is steady, we&rsquo;ve got to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
account of the motion. You can&rsquo;t do on sea
what you can on land. Ye&rsquo;ll get leg-sore if ye
keep it up too long.&rdquo; So Bert, although full of
running, took his shower and called it a morning&rsquo;s
work.</p>

<p>A shorter run in the afternoon rounded out
his first day&rsquo;s practice, and after supper the boys
sat around on deck, enjoying the cooling breeze.
Professor Davis of their own college, who was
one of the members of the Olympic Committee,
had lighted his cigar and joined the group of
Blues. Although a scholar of world-wide reputation,
he was by no means of the &ldquo;dry-as-dust&rdquo;
type. Alive to his finger tips, he was as much a
boy as any of them. All ceremony had been put
off with his scholastic cap and gown, and now, as
he sat with them in easy good fellowship, he was
for the moment not their teacher but their comrade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Professor, as he looked musingly
over the rail, while the <i>Northland</i> steadily
ploughed her way through the waves; &ldquo;what
Waterloo was to modern Europe, what Gettysburg
is to the United States, Marathon was to
Greece. Perhaps a more important battle was
never fought in the history of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chance remark about the Marathon race had
set the Professor going, and the boys eagerly
drew their chairs nearer. They were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
keenly interested in anything that savored of a
fight, and the &ldquo;Prof.&rdquo; had a striking way of
telling a story. He had the gift of making his
hearers see the thing that he described. As Tom
put it, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t give lectures, he drew pictures.&rdquo;
It was a picture that he drew now, and, as they
listened, they were no longer young Americans
of the twentieth century, but Greek youth of
twenty-five hundred years earlier. They might
have been shepherds or goatherds, tending their
flocks on the mountain slopes above the Bay of
Marathon, looking open-eyed at the great Persian
fleet of six hundred ships, as it slowly sailed
into the bay and prepared to disembark the
troops.</p>

<p>The immediate object of the expedition was
the capture and destruction of Athens, which had
defied Darius, King of Persia, and added insult
to injury by invading his territory and burning
the city of Sardis.</p>

<p>To have his beard plucked in this insolent fashion
was something new to the haughty king. He
was the autocrat of all Asia. Courtiers fawned
upon him; nations cringed before him. He styled
himself &ldquo;King of Kings and Lord of Lords,&rdquo;
and no one had the hardihood to dispute the title.
He was the Csar of the Asiatic world, and Persia
occupied the same position as that afterward
held by Rome in Europe. It was not to be borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that this little state of Athens should dare to
flout his authority. When he heard of the burning
of Sardis, his rage was frightful. He shot
an arrow into the air as a symbol of the war he
prepared to wage. He commanded that every
day a slave waiting at table should remind him:
&ldquo;Sire, remember the Athenians.&rdquo; He sent heralds
to all the Greek cities with terrible threats of
reprisals, but they were sent back with mockery
and ridicule. A mighty armament that he had
marshaled was wrecked, but, nothing daunted, he
organized another. And it was this vast army
that now threatened sack and destruction to the
cities of Greece.</p>

<p>It had already captured Eretria, and its surviving
citizens were now held in chains, waiting
for the Athenians to be joined with them and
brought into the presence of King Darius, who
was already taxing his ingenuity to devise unheard
of tortures for them. And now the galleys
had been beached on the shelving shores of
the Bay of Marathon, on the edge of which the
village stood in a plain that widened in the center,
but drew together at the ends like the horns
of a crescent. Here they leisurely came on shore,
elated at their first victory on Grecian soil and
looking confidently for a second.</p>

<p>Upon the outcome of that day hung the future
of the world. If Persia won, the last barrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
would have been demolished that shut out Asia
from Europe, and there would have been no serious
check to prevent the barbarian hordes from
swarming over the entire continent. Greek art
and culture and civilization would have been
blotted out and the entire course of history
would have been changed.</p>

<p>It seemed the fight of a pigmy against a giant.
The odds in favor of the Persians were tremendous.
Hundreds of galleys had been required to
carry their forces to the Grecian coast. One hundred
thousand men, trained and veteran warriors,
accustomed to victory, were drawn up in battle
array. Against this mighty host the Greeks had
about ten thousand men. They had sent for help
to Sparta, but, under the influence of a superstitious
custom, the Spartans had refused to march
until the moon was at the full. Only a thousand
men from Plataea came to the assistance of the
outnumbered Athenians.</p>

<p>For several days the armies faced each other,
the Persians drawn up on the plain of Marathon
and the Greeks encamped on a hillside a mile distant.
There were ten commanders of the little
force, and opinion was divided as to whether they
should attack at once or wait for the help of
Sparta. By a narrow margin the bolder policy
prevailed, and it was decided to grapple with the
enemy then and there.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The Persians were astounded when they saw
the devoted little army rushing down the slope
and making at double-quick across the plain,
chanting their battle song. It seemed like madness
or suicide. Half contemptuously, they
formed ranks to receive them. The Greeks burst
upon them with irresistible fury. The very
fierceness and audacity of the attack confused
and demoralized their opponents. The center
stood its ground, but the wings gave way. Soon
the battle became a rout; the rout a massacre.
The Persians were beaten back to their galleys
with terrible loss and hastily put out to sea. The
Greeks lost only a hundred and ninety-two men,
and over the bodies of these was erected a huge
funeral mound that remains to the present day,
as a memorial of that wonderful fight.</p>

<p>The battle had been begun in the late afternoon
and dusk had fallen when the slaughter
ceased. After the first wild jubilation the thought
of the victors turned toward Athens, twenty-six
miles away. The city was waiting with bated
breath for news of the struggle, watching, praying,
fearing, scarcely daring to hope. News must
be gotten to them at once. Pheidippides, a noted
runner, started off on foot. The roads were
rough and hilly, but he ran through the night as
one inspired. To all he met he shouted the news
and kept on with unabated ardor. Hills rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fell behind him. His breath came in gasps. On
he went, the fire of patriotic passion burning in
his veins. Now from the brow of a hill he saw
the lights of Athens.</p>

<p>On, on he ran, but by this time his legs were
wavering, his brain was reeling. He had not
spared himself and now he was nearly spent. He
gathered himself together for one last effort and
staggered into the market place where all the city
had gathered. They rushed forward to meet him.
He gasped out: &ldquo;Rejoice. We conquer,&rdquo; and
fell dead at their feet. His glorious exploit with
its tragical ending made him a national hero, and
his name was held in reverence as long as the
city endured.</p>

<p>The speaker stopped, and for a few minutes
no one spoke. The boys had been too deeply
stirred. Their thoughts were still with that
lonely runner rushing through the night. It was
a shock to come from beneath the spell and get
back to the present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Professor,&rdquo; said Tom, at last,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve seen the place where the battle
was fought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I was there on the
same trip when I visited Olympia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; broke in Bert, &ldquo;the identical place
where the first Olympic games were held nearly
three thousand years ago?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The identical spot,&rdquo; smiled the professor.
&ldquo;You can still see the walls of the old Stadium
where the games were held. Of course the
greater part of it is in ruins after so long a time,
but you can get a very good idea of the whole
thing. It&rsquo;s a beautiful spot and I don&rsquo;t wonder
the old Greeks went crazy over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those fellows were &lsquo;fresh-air fiends,&rsquo; all
right,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think they
had any homes. Everything you read about
seems to have happened in the streets or the market
place or the gymnasium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the professor, &ldquo;the Greeks
were a nation of festivals. They lived out of
doors, and their glorious climate made possible
all sorts of open-air gatherings and recreations.
Their love of beauty, as shown especially in the
human form, found expression in the sports and
exercises that developed the body to the fullest
extent. They did not neglect the soul&mdash;Plato and
Socrates and hosts of others bear testimony to
that&mdash;but the body and its development were always
uppermost in their thoughts. They honored
their thinkers, but they worshipped their athletes.
Physical exercises began almost in infancy
and continued to extreme old age and the chief
honors of the state were reserved for those who
excelled in some form of bodily strength. Poets
sang about them and statues were raised to them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What games did they have?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much the same as ours,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;There was a hippodrome for chariot
racing, and if you boys remember the description
in &lsquo;Ben-Hur,&rsquo; you can imagine how exciting it
was. Then there were foot races, at first a single
lap around the course, but afterward developing
into middle and long-distance running. Besides
these were wrestling, leaping, discus-throwing,
boxing and hurling the javelin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I like about them,&rdquo; said
Bert. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t bloodthirsty, like the
Romans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we must give them credit for that.
There were no better fighters in the world. But
the infliction of wanton cruelty, the shedding of
blood needlessly, the gloating over human suffering,
was wholly repulsive to the Greeks. Perhaps
they hated it, not because it was wicked, but because
it was ugly. Rome wallowed in wounds
and blood. It shouted with delight as gladiators
hewed and hacked each other and wild beasts
tore women and children to pieces. Its horrible
thirst was never slaked and its appetite grew by
what it fed upon. The Coliseum with its sickening
sights could never have existed in Greece.
The Romans developed the brute in man; the
Greeks developed the god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they had to train pretty hard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the games,&rdquo; mused Bert, as he thought of the iron
rule of Reddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly did,&rdquo; laughed the professor.
&ldquo;You fellows think you have to work hard, but
they worked harder. Why, they had to train
steadily for ten months before they entered for
any event. Then, too, they had to walk pretty
straight. Before the games, a herald challenged
all who might know of any wrong thing a competitor
had done to stand forth and declare it
openly. So that when a man came out winner, he
had a certificate of character as well as skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt the fellows that won were looked
upon as the real thing,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; said the professor. &ldquo;The
value placed upon a victory was almost incredible.
To our cooler Western natures it seems
excessive. The fellow citizens of the victor carried
him home in triumph. They supported him
for the rest of his life. He became the first
citizen in the state. The town walls were broken
down so that he might enter by a path that had
never before been trodden by human foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Dick, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
Uncle Sam will go as crazy as all that when Bert
comes home with the Marathon prize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>If</i> he comes home with it, you mean,&rdquo; corrected
Bert. &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s many a slip &rsquo;twixt cup
and lip,&rsquo; and I may be in for one of the slips.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether you are or not,&rdquo; rejoined the professor,
as they rose to retire, &ldquo;rests &lsquo;on the lap
of the gods.&rsquo; But what we do know is that, win
or lose, you&rsquo;re going to do your best.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In the Liner&rsquo;s Path</span></h3>


<p class="cap">For several hours now the air had seemed
very close and oppressive, and the experienced
captain of the <i>Northland</i> felt, through
some mysterious sixth sense born of long experience,
that a storm was brewing. You may be
sure that he gave the matter a good deal more
thought than the reckless group of high-spirited
boys on board, who would have been satisfied
with any kind of weather that came along, provided
it gave them a little diversion and excitement.
Indeed, it may be that they would even
have looked on a shipwreck as something rather
pleasant than otherwise, and have regarded it as
an ideal chance for adventure.</p>

<p>One reads much in books of the romantic side
of shipwreck, but the horrors and privations of
such an experience are glossed over. It is safe to
say that anyone who has once gone through such
a catastrophe will have no desire to repeat it.</p>

<p>Along toward dusk of their second day out,
the sky became very overcast, and a gradual drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in the temperature occurred. Of course, the captain
and officers were besieged with questions regarding
the cause of this, and they had no difficulty
in explaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Captain Everett, unconsciously
assuming the pose of a lecturer, &ldquo;we are now
approaching the Grand Banks of Newfoundland,
and getting near the ice regions further north.
The comparatively near presence of these icebergs
naturally cools the air somewhat, and that
accounts for the lower temperature we all feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read somewhere,&rdquo; remarked Tom,
&ldquo;that the ice is responsible for the frequent
fogs found in this section of the map, but I must
confess I could never quite figure out why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s on account of the ice melting so
fast in the warmer air,&rdquo; explained the captain,
&ldquo;it gives off a thick mist, and when the air is so
warm that the ice melts fast enough, it forms a
very dense fog. I&rsquo;ve read a lot about London
fogs, and seen &rsquo;em, too, but they can&rsquo;t hold a
candle to the fogs you run into on the Banks.
And from the way things look now, I rather think
you&rsquo;re going to have a chance to judge for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, it was as the captain said. In the distance
was what looked to be a low-lying island,
but they were assured that it was in reality a fog
bank, lying close to the water. It drifted nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and nearer, and before they knew it had begun
to envelop the ship. First they were conscious
of a damp, cold feeling in the air, and then gradually
nearby objects grew less and less distinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; laughed Dick, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d
better get some rope and tie ourselves together
before it&rsquo;s too late. We&rsquo;re not going to be able
to see each other very long, if this keeps up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; responded Bert. &ldquo;Why, I can
hardly see my own hand now, and for all I know
my feet may have walked off on their own hook
and got lost in this infernal mist. I can&rsquo;t see
them, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I hope they haven&rsquo;t, old top,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it might be rather an inconvenience
to you to lose them just now. It will be quite a
handicap when you try to run a few days from
now, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I think I could run about
as fast on my hands as you could on your feet,&rdquo;
retorted Bert, and turned the laugh against Tom.</p>

<p>But by now it was really impossible to see objects
more than five feet away, and the boys had
to grope their way about with outstretched hands,
like so many blind persons. After a while somebody
started a game of &ldquo;blind-man&rsquo;s tag,&rdquo; as
they christened it. The one who was &ldquo;it&rdquo; had
to locate the others by sound, and when he
thought he had done so would make a wild rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in the general direction of the noise. Then there
would be a wild scramble to get out of his way,
and more than one laughing athlete was sent
sprawling in a head-on collision. They kept this
up till they were tired, and then dropped down
on the deck to rest and listen to the yarns of
the sailors. Naturally these tales were all about
troubles at sea due to fogs, and many a weird
story was told that stamped the teller as an inventive
genius. Each one tried to crowd more exciting
events into his tale than the last narrator, and
the result was lurid.</p>

<p>Of course, in most of the stories some part
was based on an actual occurrence, but to sift out
the truth was like looking for the proverbial
needle in a haystack. However, these old tars
were past masters at the art, and there is no
doubt that they made their stories interesting.
The boys listened with great interest, now and
then putting in a question when it seemed needed.</p>

<p>Mermaids and sea serpents abound in many
of these yarns, and, as Bert afterward remarked,
&ldquo;seemed commoner than squirrels in a park.&rdquo;
But they passed the time away very pleasantly,
and before the boys realized it, Reddy was among
them, commanding, &ldquo;Off with ye now, and get a
good night&rsquo;s rest. Ye should have all been in
bed a good half-hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course there was no resisting this mandate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
even had they been so inclined, so off to bed they
went, groping and stumbling through the fog,
that by this time had grown dense almost beyond
belief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, as he tripped
over a coil of rope and then slipped on the slippery
deck. &ldquo;I only hope this old tub doesn&rsquo;t go
ramming any icebergs the way the old <i>Titanic</i> did
a little while ago. Mermaids may be all right in
stories, but I don&rsquo;t care to make their acquaintance
under water just yet a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think I can pike along a little while
longer without a closer acquaintance,&rdquo; laughed
Bert, &ldquo;and also without seeing any hundred-foot
sea serpents in their native element. Why, according
to the stories we&rsquo;ve just been swallowing,
one of those fellows could twine himself around
the Woolworth Building and wave his head over
the roof without half trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and I imagine
it would be rather embarrassing to look up and
find one gazing at you through the skylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised,&rdquo; said Bert.
&ldquo;However, I guess we won&rsquo;t lie awake very long
to-night worrying about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; acquiesced Dick, and with a few
more remarks along the same line they descended
the steep cabin companionway. It was a relief to
get out of the dense, clammy fog, and you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
be sure the dry, comfortable berths felt very
grateful to the tired athletes. In less time than
it takes to tell, they had all dropped off into deep
slumber.</p>

<p>It seemed but a few moments later when Dick
found himself sitting bolt upright in his berth,
with a vague but none the less terrifying sensation
that something terrible had happened. At
first he thought he must have been dreaming, but
a moment later shouts and cries on deck dispelled
this idea. Dick hastily awakened Bert and Tom
and all three bounded up on deck, where they
found everything in confusion.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the companionway
hatch they saw that the fog still held, thicker,
if that were possible, than when they had gone
below. The captain was shouting orders from
the bridge, and members of the crew were scurrying
wildly here and there across the slippery
decks.</p>

<p>The ship&rsquo;s engines had been stopped, as they
could tell by the absence of vibration, but it was
several minutes before they could get hold of
anybody to tell them what was amiss. Finally,
however, they managed to stop one of the crew
long enough to be told that they had rammed
what appeared to be a fishing schooner, and that
the latter was sinking fast. Then the sailor hurried
off on his interrupted errand, and the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
boys dashed forward to the bows, where most of
the excitement seemed to be.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer the forward part of the
vessel they were able to see grotesque figures, distorted
by the fog, hurrying to and fro. Soon, as
their eyes became accustomed more and more to
the dim light of lanterns, they could make out
the outline of the mast and rigging of a sailing
vessel close against the side of their own ship.</p>

<p>Up this rigging men were climbing swiftly, and
jumping on to the deck of the <i>Northland</i>. Already
there was a group of eight strange sailors
standing there, with more coming all the time.
Even as the boys watched, however, the mast of
the sailing vessel gave a great lurch, and a cry
went up from everybody watching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, hurry!&rdquo; went up a shout
from those on the stricken vessel. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sinking
beneath our feet. Jump lively there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the light of the binnacle lamp on the sinking
vessel could be seen the sturdy figure of her
captain, standing immovable and calm and giving
orders as coolly as though he were not in the
slightest danger. According to the unwritten law
of the sea, a captain may not leave his ship until
all his crew are off, and it was plain that this man
would be staunch to the end.</p>

<p>It became evident that the doomed vessel was
sinking fast, and there were still several men on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
her deck waiting their turn to climb the rigging
to safety. Could they possibly get up before the
ship foundered?&mdash;that was the question.</p>

<p>The mast sank lower and lower, until the last
sailor up had to be grasped by friendly outstretched
arms and dragged over the rail. There
was now no reason for the captain to stay on
deck, and seeing this, he made a dash for the
mast. But he was a second too late. The
waves for several minutes had been lapping at
the decks of the doomed craft, which lay at a
sharp angle to the water, and now with a sickening
lurch it dived under the waves, taking its devoted
captain with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower a boat, there! Lower a boat,&rdquo; vociferated
the captain of the <i>Northland</i>, and the
crew hastened to obey. In an incredibly short
time two boats had been manned and lowered,
and began cruising about over the spot where the
vessel had sunk. In that dense fog, however,
there seemed little hope of ever again seeing the
heroic captain, and they were just on the point
of giving up the search and returning to their ship
when suddenly they heard what seemed to be a
faint shout for help out of the fog about fifty
yards from them. They rowed toward the
sound, after shouting back encouragingly, and it
was not long before they made out the figure of
a man struggling stoutly in the icy water.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell they had fished
him out, and started rowing back to the steamer.
Soon they were on board, and were accorded a
royal reception by the assembled passengers and
crew, all of whom were by this time on deck.</p>

<p>The man whom they had picked up proved to
be the captain of the foundered vessel, and everybody
crowded forward to shake his hand and congratulate
him on his escape.</p>

<p>But now Captain Everett pressed through the
crowd, and after greeting the unfortunate skipper
and expressing his deep regret over the accident,
hustled him off to his cabin. Here he was
wrapped in blankets, and served with boiling hot
coffee.</p>

<p>After he had recovered his strength somewhat,
he proceeded to give his account of the accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a lucky day yesterday,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and were anchored over the same spot, intending
to start in again early the next morning.
Most of the crew was asleep, and on account of
this cursed fog our lookout was unable to see your
vessel until it was too late to give warning. But
fortunately, every body was saved, and as the
ship was fully insured, matters might have been
much worse, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Everett, &ldquo;we were steaming
only at quarter speed, or we would not have
been able to get about in time to render you assistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I am very thankful that no lives were
lost, which is rare good fortune in an accident
of this kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, for a fact,&rdquo; responded the other, and
sank into silence. He appeared to be troubled
in mind, and little wonder. Even though he
were not actually to blame for the disaster, as of
course he was not, still he knew that his employers
would hold him responsible. And there is
probably no other profession in the world where
a clear record is more highly prized than in seafaring.</p>

<p>However, under the cheerful influence of the
cabin table his depression seemed to lighten somewhat,
and he joined in the general conversation.
He proved to be a man of some education and
widely varied experience, and he recounted many
tales of peril by sea.</p>

<p>It was late before the party broke up, and the
unfortunate mariner was shown to his cabin. He
and the members of his rescued crew stayed on
the <i>Northland</i> several days, but then a homeward
bound vessel was hailed and they were placed on
board. There were hearty leave-takings on both
sides, with mutual expressions of regret.</p>

<p>As the ships rapidly drew apart, the captain
and crew of the sunken sailing vessel lined the
rail, and waved to the athletes until their figures
became indistinguishable.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bert, as they turned away.
&ldquo;That was an occurrence that we won&rsquo;t forget
in quite some time, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet your life it was,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t every voyage that we get the chance to do
the rescue stunt like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is a very fortunate thing,&rdquo; remarked
Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right for us, and gives us a lot
of excitement, but it&rsquo;s not much fun for the poor
fellows that get wrecked. Here&rsquo;s their vessel,
which they probably thought a lot of, as all sailors
do, gone, and their employment with it, for the
time at least. And that&rsquo;s saying nothing of the
close approach to death which they had. I think
I&rsquo;d rather pursue some other occupation than that
of the sea. You have too many chances of making
a personal visit to the well known Mr. Davy
Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; agreed Tom, with a twinkle in his
eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather do something safe, like running
a sixty-horsepower automobile at the rate of
eighty miles an hour, or some other little amusement
like that, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Bert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; grinned Bert, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
doubt that that&rsquo;s the safest thing in the world to
do. You never hear of anyone getting hurt doing
that, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve
even heard that doctors recommend it to patients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
suffering from nervous disorders, and requiring
a little mild diversion. In fact, it&rsquo;s the customary
thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; said Bert, and then they
all joined in a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>After this they dispersed to their various training
&ldquo;stunts,&rdquo; which must be gone through,
wrecks or no wrecks.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Man Overboard!</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Dusk had succeeded the glorious sun-set and
touched it with the sombre hue of twilight.
The day had been exceptionally hot, a day when
one seems to find just sufficient energy to lounge
in an easy chair under the pretense of reading
a novel until a delightful drowsiness creeps over
you and all pretense is at an end&mdash;you are sleeping
the sleep of the just on a scorching summer
day.</p>

<p>But now night had descended on the stately
<i>Northland</i>, and with it had come a cool, refreshing
breeze. All was quiet, serene, peaceful, and
among the passengers, lounging in groups about
the deck, conversation was carried on in undertones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; Tom was saying, softly. &ldquo;This has
been one great day, hasn&rsquo;t it? Nothing to do
but hang around on deck, alternately reading,
sleeping and watching the wheels go &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess this is about the first day since
we have been on board that something exciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hasn&rsquo;t happened and it seems mighty good for a
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; Bert warned. &ldquo;The day isn&rsquo;t
over yet and there is plenty of time for something
exciting to happen between this and midnight.
For my part, I wouldn&rsquo;t much mind if it
did, for after a day like this you feel as if you
needed something to wake you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; Tom queried, sarcastically. &ldquo;I
feel just now as if I had more urgent need of
something to put me to sleep,&rdquo; and with a yawn
he dropped into a convenient chair and settled
himself comfortably with his feet against the rail.
&ldquo;Sing us that song you used to sing at college before
we threatened to set the Black Hand on your
trail, Dick,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;Perhaps that will help
to woo sweet slumber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be much more likely to woo sweet
nightmare,&rdquo; said Bert, which was true if not complimentary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Dick retorted, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;Of course, I understand that this apparent
reluctance on your part is due entirely to
sour grapes since you doubtless are aware of the
fact that I never would condescend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh can it,&rdquo; Tom murmured, sleepily. &ldquo;If
you won&rsquo;t sing, the least you can do is to keep still
and let a fellow go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; Dick said, obligingly, &ldquo;anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you wish. As I was saying,&rdquo; he went on
with a wink at Bert, &ldquo;you are doubtless aware
that I would never condescend to render that immortal
ballad before so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have gone too far,&rdquo; Tom cried in a
terrible voice, as he sprang for Dick. &ldquo;You
have dared disobey my mandates and now you
shall suffer the penalty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the mock tragedy was never enacted, for,
even as Tom spoke, his attention was caught by
the figure of a man covered from head to foot
with soot and grime and running toward their end
of the deck at full speed. At his heels was a
crowd led by the steward who cried out frantically
to the boys, &ldquo;Stop him, stop him! He&rsquo;s gone
mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So suddenly had come the thunder-bolt from a
clear sky that for a few seconds the boys could
do nothing but stare at the spectacle before them
and wonder if they could be awake. In fact,
Bert confessed later that he had had a faint impression
that Dick&rsquo;s nightmare must have come
upon them ahead of time.</p>

<p>Bert was the first to take in the situation and
with a cry of, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s up to us, fellows,&rdquo; he
ran toward the wild figure now only a few feet in
front of them. But even as the three comrades
threw out their hands to halt the flying madman,
he paused, glared around him for an instant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the look of a hunted animal brought to bay, and
then, with a fierce, inhuman cry that echoed in
Bert&rsquo;s memory for many a long day after, he
threw himself over the rail and into the glassy
depths nearly forty feet below!</p>

<p>For a brief moment there was the silence of
death on board the <i>Northland</i>, and then arose
such an uproar that even the captain&rsquo;s great voice,
shouting orders to the crew, could scarcely be
heard above the din.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nought but a stoker gone crazy with the
heat of the day,&rdquo; Bert heard a man say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; growled a stoker who had also overheard.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a wonder that we are all not crazy
or dead this day, but that poor devil is worse off
than us for he can&rsquo;t swim a stroke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say that that man can&rsquo;t swim?&rdquo; Bert
demanded, while a look of horror crept over his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I did, young feller,&rdquo; the stoker answered,
as he eyed Bert insolently from head to
foot, &ldquo;though doubtless he can find something
to hang on to until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bert never heard the end of the sentence
for he was busy untying his shoes and stripping
off his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert, Bert, you are never going to risk your
life needlessly for that madman,&rdquo; Tom pleaded.
&ldquo;The boat is stopping, now, and it will pick him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
up in a few minutes. Anyway he&rsquo;s crazy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bert stopped him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; he
said simply, &ldquo;and he can&rsquo;t swim.&rdquo; Then there
was a flash of white in the air, a quick splash and
Bert was on his way to save a life.</p>

<p>Down there in the eddy and swirl of the waves,
Bert had but one thought, one hope&mdash;to reach
that little speck that he had sighted from the deck
of the steamer. Nor did it once occur to him
that he could have acted otherwise. One of his
fellow beings had need of his splendid strength
and skill, and not until they failed him would he
give up the fight.</p>

<p>So on and on he swam, taxing his great vitality
and endurance to the utmost. But to his tortured
fancy it seemed as though he were being dragged
backward. Surely he could not be making any
progress at all at this speed. Then a fierce feeling
of anger swept over him, burning him like a
flame&mdash;anger at this feeling of impotence that
threatened to master him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would think,&rdquo; he raged, &ldquo;that I had
never been outside a country town in my life. I
am making progress. I can save that fellow&rsquo;s
life, and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, that was better! Now every long, powerful
stroke did its work and soon he was within a
few feet of the spot where the madman was holding
on to a slippery piece of driftwood, that now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and again slipped from his numbed fingers, only
to be regained by a desperate effort.</p>

<p>As Bert neared him, the stoker cried out frantically,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me! Don&rsquo;t touch me!
I&rsquo;ll kill you if you do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as he spoke his fingers lost their grip and
he would have sunk below the surface if it had
not been for Bert&rsquo;s cat-like quickness. In a flash,
he had grasped the stoker around the waist and
lifted his head above the water, but he was not
quite prepared for what was to follow.</p>

<p>For a second the stoker lay passive in Bert&rsquo;s
grasp, gasping for breath. Then with the quick,
sinuous motion of a reptile he twisted about and
met his fingers around Bert&rsquo;s throat in the vise-like
grip that only a maniac can effect and began
slowly to tighten his hold.</p>

<p>In desperation Bert tore at the relentless fingers,
fighting with all the fierceness of a wild
animal for his life. But the more he struggled
the tighter grew that band of iron about his neck.
They were under water now, but not even threatened
suffocation could make the madman loose
his grip. Tighter and tighter it grew, until Bert
felt the blood go pounding up into his brain and
his eyes seemed starting from his head.</p>

<p>Was this to be the end, then, of all his hopes,
of all his dreams, of all his aspirations? His
college, his friends, his two dear comrades, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he to lose all these now, when his future was filled
with such bright promise? And that by the hands
of a man he had risked his life to save!</p>

<p>Then once again came that rush of wild, hot
anger, this time a thousandfold more fierce than
before, and again it seemed to give him exhaustless
strength. He drew his arm back slowly, and
then with all the strength of his body behind it
planted his fist squarely in the madman&rsquo;s forehead.</p>

<p>Then, at last, that iron grip loosened and the
fingers relaxed their hold. With great joy and
exultation in his heart, Bert grasped the arm as
it slipped past him and dragged him to the surface.</p>

<p>With a feeling of exquisite comfort and ease,
he floated on his back, drawing in great breaths
of the glorious air into his tortured lungs.
Softly as in a dream he heard the faint dip of
oars in the water and then came Dick&rsquo;s voice
calling his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Bert,&rdquo; it was saying.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean we will if this hanged boat ever
stops going backward and makes up its mind to
travel in the right direction,&rdquo; Tom said impatiently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been five minutes getting nowhere,
already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop your growling, Tom,&rdquo; Dick commanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
&ldquo;You ought to be so all-fired thankful
to see Bert floating on the surface instead of
being entertained in Davy Jones&rsquo; locker that you
wouldn&rsquo;t have time for anything but thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose that I&rsquo;m not thankful, do
you,&rdquo; Tom demanded, huskily. &ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t
come up again after we saw him go under I&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;Bert,&rdquo;
he called, lustily, to hide the
break in his voice, &ldquo;can you hear us now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; came a weak voice that they
nevertheless recognized as Bert&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Then the rowers redoubled their efforts and
in a few strokes had reached the spot where Bert
floated with his still-unconscious burden. In less
time than it takes to tell, willing hands had lifted
the stoker into the boat and Bert was half
dragged, half pushed in after him. For the
fierce, superhuman strength that had come to him
in his extremity had passed as quickly as it had
come, leaving him as weak as a rag. It had
been through sheer grit and will power that he
had been able to hold on to the stoker until the
boat could relieve him.</p>

<p>As he was hauled into the boat, Dick and Tom
fell upon him, half laughing, half crying and
wholly joyful. They showered him with praises
and called him every endearing name they could
think of, such as&mdash;&ldquo;dear old fellow, game old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
scout,&rdquo; and a hundred others equally incoherent
but eminently satisfactory.</p>

<p>After five minutes of hard pulling, the little
boat reached the steamer&rsquo;s side. Her rails were
crowded with passengers, waiting to welcome in
the first real drama that many of them had ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>As Bert was helped on deck he was welcomed
with a rousing cheer that might have been heard
for a mile around the ship. Bert flushed with
pleasure and acknowledged the salute as best he
could in his dripping garments, while he whispered
to his two companions:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me into the cabin as soon as you can,
will you, fellows? It&rsquo;s fine of them to greet me
so right royally, but I know I must look a wreck
and it wouldn&rsquo;t feel so very bad to get some dry
clothes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the stoker, who had not regained
consciousness, was taken below to receive medical
attention. As the sailors laid him on his
bunk they muttered discontentedly of the inadvisability
of rescuing mad stokers, who were little
better than land lubbers, anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure and now we&rsquo;ll be having one more
worthless shpalpeen on our hands,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien was
saying. &ldquo;Oi&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; as it wasn&rsquo;t a brave
thing that that young feller has been afther doin&rsquo;,
but jist the same it would &rsquo;a been bether to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
left him there and saved us the throuble of burying
of him later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, so say I,&rdquo; growled another. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
probably die before the week&rsquo;s out, and &rsquo;tis my
opinion that he&rsquo;s better dead than alive, seein&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s crazy, poor devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! he&rsquo;s conscious,&rdquo; warned the doctor,
as he rose from his kneeling position beside the
bunk. &ldquo;He will do nicely, now, with good care.
I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour to see how he&rsquo;s getting
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the doctor left the room, the two sailors
neared the stoker, who lay with his eyes closed,
as if absolutely oblivious to their presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old b&rsquo;y,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, &ldquo;how be ye
feelin&rsquo; afther your duckin&rsquo;? Pretty spry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly the man opened his eyes and let them
rest for a long minute on the big Irishman&rsquo;s
ruddy face. When he spoke, the words came
haltingly, as if he were groping in his memory
for facts that persistently eluded him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to recollect,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just
exactly what happened. Was I&mdash;did I&rdquo;&mdash;and
the fear and pleading in his voice went straight
to O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s heart&mdash;&ldquo;was I&mdash;mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you worry about that, son,&rdquo;
O&rsquo;Brien lied, kindly. &ldquo;Ye wuzn&rsquo;t mad, ye wuz
jist a thrifle touched be the heat. Oi&rsquo;ll bet anythin&rsquo;
ye&rsquo;ll be up &rsquo;n aroun&rsquo; as hale an&rsquo; hearty as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the skipper himself in a day or two.&rdquo; Then he
added in an undertone to his companion, &ldquo;Bedad,
an&rsquo; if he ain&rsquo;t as sane as any man jack of us, me
name ain&rsquo;t Pat O&rsquo;Brien. Sure an&rsquo; Oi ain&rsquo;t niver
seen the loike of it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; the other answered in awestruck
tones. &ldquo;He goes off the boat madder
than a March hare and comes back after a dip
in the briny and a knock-out punch over one eye
seemin&rsquo; as right as a trivet. It beats all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man on the bed had been
watching the men wistfully, and as O&rsquo;Brien
turned to him again, he asked eagerly, &ldquo;Please
tell me everything. I know I was out of my
head, so you needn&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure and Oi will, then,&rdquo; Pat said, heartily,
and he did, from beginning to end, omitting
nothing.</p>

<p>When the tale was finished the doctor came
again to have another look at his patient and
was surprised and delighted at his improvement.
&ldquo;Why, at this rate we&rsquo;ll have you up and around
by this time day after to-morrow,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; as the stoker whispered something
in his ear. &ldquo;Why, yes, I guess he will
come. I&rsquo;ll give him your message, anyway, and
see what he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with a cheerful nod he left his patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the enjoyment of a well-cooked, appetizing
meal.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Bert, clad once more in
dry, snug clothes, made his way hurriedly below
to the stokers&rsquo; cabin. He had declined his
friends&rsquo; offer to accompany him, for his instinct
told him that the stoker would prefer to see him
alone.</p>

<p>As he turned the knob of the door the stoker
looked around inquiringly. Bert went forward
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Bert Wilson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The doctor
gave me your message and I came as soon as I
could get a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very good of you to come, sir,&rdquo; the
man replied, nervously fumbling with a glass on
the table at his elbow. &ldquo;You see, I wanted to
thank you and tell you how sorry I am that I
gave you&mdash;any&mdash;trouble in the water.&rdquo; His
voice was scarcely above a whisper. &ldquo;I can
jist recollect, now, that I tried to&mdash;kill&mdash;you.
Can you ever&mdash;forgive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive,&rdquo; Bert interrupted. &ldquo;Why, I have
nothing to forgive, but if I had I would have
forgiven and forgotten long ago.&rdquo; Then he put
out his hand impulsively and said in that frank,
open way that was peculiarly his own, &ldquo;You and
I have gone through great danger together and
have managed to pull through with nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a few scratches to tell the story. Shall we shake
hands on it?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Well, you sure did get everything that was
coming to you, Bert,&rdquo; Tom said, as they were
getting ready for bed that night. &ldquo;You asked
for excitement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I got it,&rdquo; Bert finished, as he slipped
in between the cool, inviting sheets. &ldquo;Good-night,
fellows, I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crooked Work</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Yes, me byes, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; in this wide
world much worse, to me manner o&rsquo;
thinkin&rsquo;, than a &lsquo;ringer.&rsquo;&rdquo; It was Reddy who
spoke, following up a conversation in which most
of the athletes had joined. &ldquo;Crookedness is a
bad thing in any line of business or amusement,
but it&rsquo;s specially bad in anythin&rsquo; like sport, that
in its very nature ought to be kept clean and
wholesome. It&rsquo;s a queer thing, though, but true
none the less, that there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; much worse
than some branches o&rsquo; sport. Look at prize
fightin&rsquo;, fer instance. O&rsquo; course, I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo;
that some fights aren&rsquo;t on the level, an&rsquo; all that,
but take them as a rule and the scraps and scrappers
are so crooked they could hide behind a
corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there are lots of other things the
same way,&rdquo; observed Bert, who was one of the
group. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told that wrestling is as
crooked, if not more so, than boxing. Do you
think it is, Reddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a hard question, m&rsquo; son,&rdquo; returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the veteran trainer, thoughtfully. &ldquo;When
you get right down to it, there&rsquo;s not much to
choose between them. I&rsquo;ve seen many a boxin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; wrestlin&rsquo; bout in my time, but there&rsquo;s very
few that I thought was straight from start to
finish. It&rsquo;s a wonder to me how the fight promoters
manage to keep on fooling the public.
It looks to me as though a babe in arms would
get wise to their game. But nix! The poor
ginks will file out of a hall after a rotten go,
swearing they&rsquo;ll never spend a cent to see another
fight, and the next week they&rsquo;re back again, same
as ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s not as much underhand work
in other lines of sport as in that, though, is there,
Reddy?&rdquo; questioned Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think there is,&rdquo; answered Reddy,
speculatively. &ldquo;Of course, among amateurs,
there generally isn&rsquo;t the money incentive that the
professionals have, and that makes a big difference.
The hard thing, when you&rsquo;re dealing with
amateur meets, is to keep professionals out.
Some club will want specially to win a race, and
like as not they&rsquo;ll look around for some professional,
who&rsquo;s not too well known, to help them
out. It&rsquo;s a dirty, low-down trick, o&rsquo; course, but
it&rsquo;s tried many a time, just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;why doesn&rsquo;t the amateur
up and beat the professional at his own game?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
There&rsquo;s nothing very wonderful about a man,
just because he runs for money, instead of the
honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thrue fer you, me bye,&rdquo; returned Reddy,
smiling, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s sometimes easier said than
done. A man who&rsquo;s running to earn his bread
is usually going to run faster than the man who&rsquo;s
simply out fer glory. That may not sound very
noble, and all that, but it&rsquo;s the truth, nine times
out o&rsquo; ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how about the tenth time?&rdquo; asked
Bert, who had been listening attentively to all the
trainer said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, once in a great while the &lsquo;ringer&rsquo; gets
tripped up, o&rsquo; course. I remember one time,
many a long year ago, when I saw jist the thing
you mentioned happen,&rdquo; and a reminiscent smile
spread over the veteran&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>The listening group of young athletes sensed
a story at once, and assailed Reddy with requests
to &ldquo;fire away, and tell them about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trainer seemed in a talkative mood, and
without much urging, began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas whin I was but a young lad,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but even thin I was always interested in sport
of any kind, and used to attend ivery track event
for miles around the little town where I lived.
I used to help around the club houses, carryin&rsquo;
water and such things, and got to know, by sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
at any rate, a good many well-known runners
and sich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one day there was a big college meet
not far from our town, and o&rsquo; course nothin&rsquo;
would do me but what I must see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordin&rsquo;ly, I was hangin&rsquo; around the club
house long before the time for the race, and had
plenty o&rsquo; time to size up the contestants. They
were as fine lookin&rsquo; a set o&rsquo; byes as you could
wish to see, and they was all jokin&rsquo; and rough-housin&rsquo;
as though they had never a care on their
minds. I knew they&rsquo;d be in dead enough earnest
in a little while, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the time come for them to get dressed
in their runnin&rsquo; togs, and suddenly I began to
sit up an&rsquo; take notice, as you might say. As one
big, sthrappin&rsquo; feller, that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed much
before, on account o&rsquo; his havin&rsquo; kept apart a
little from the others, and havin&rsquo; been so quiet-like,
stood up in his runnin&rsquo; suit, it flashed across
me mind that I&rsquo;d seen him run some place before.
At first I couldn&rsquo;t place him, think as hard as I
might, but suddenly I remembered where I&rsquo;d seen
him. It was at a race held about a year ago,
and then he had run in the hundred-yard dash
with professionals and had come in third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what do ye know about that,&rsquo; thinks
I to myself, &lsquo;the good fer nothin&rsquo; crook is goin&rsquo;
to run against these young fellers, and it&rsquo;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
cinch he&rsquo;ll cop off the prize.&rsquo; And, believe me,
I felt sorry for the other boys that was goin&rsquo; to
race against him, fer I knew he was fast, although
not among the first-raters, and I figured
that none o&rsquo; the others would have a show in his
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, there was nothin&rsquo; I could do, for
nobody would have taken my word for it, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; got laughed at fer my trouble. So I kept
me own council, and sat tight, but all interest in
the big race was lost fer me, for I hated crooked
work about as much then as I do now, I guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a young feller from C&mdash;&mdash; that
I&rsquo;d picked to win the hundred-yard dash, before
I recognized this ringer chap. (His name was
Smith, by the way, but he was known now, I
found out, as Castle.) Young Sidney was a
game kid, all right, from his toes up. He wasn&rsquo;t
very tall, and at first glance you wouldn&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;d be any great shakes as a runner. But he
could get away at the crack o&rsquo; the pistol about
as fast as any man I ever saw, barrin&rsquo; none, and
he could certainly burn up the track fer a short
distance. He was never much on the long distances,
but he was sure class on everythin&rsquo; up to
three hundred yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d seen him run several times, and once or
twice when I&rsquo;d brought him a drink o&rsquo; water, or
somethin&rsquo; like that, he&rsquo;d grin at me an&rsquo; give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a pleasant word or two. So I had a likin&rsquo; for
him, and was minded to put him wise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the first chance I got I sidled up to him
and tipped him off that this Castle feller was a
&lsquo;profesh.&rsquo; He gives a long whistle, and looks
pretty much surprised, naturally. But he was
game, clear through, and he says to me, &lsquo;Well,
kid, I don&rsquo;t care if he is a professional. I&rsquo;m as
good a man as he is, and I think I can beat him,
anyway. It&rsquo;s the only chance I have, because
I&rsquo;m not going to squeal to the officials.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I liked him all the more for that, and
o&rsquo; course wished him all kinds o&rsquo; luck. Me heart
was heavy fer him, though, for I didn&rsquo;t think he
would get a look-in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By now the time had come fer the lads to
line up, and they all filed out o&rsquo; the club house,
as sober as so many deacons. The starter got
them in position, and everythin&rsquo; was ready fer
the event. There were five starters, and each
one looked to have a chance to the finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get on your mark! Get set!&rsquo; yelled the
starter, and pointed his little pistol up in the air.
Crack! she went, and the lads were off in a bunch,
runnin&rsquo; as though the old Nick were after thim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;ringer&rsquo; chap was up to all the tricks
of the trade, howiver, and had &lsquo;beat this pistol&rsquo;
by the shade of an eyelash. He had a five-foot
lead on young Sidney before they&rsquo;d gone eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
yards, and that&rsquo;s an awful lot in a hundred-yard
sprint. &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; thinks I to meself, &lsquo;the
ringer&rsquo;s won the race already,&rsquo; and the thought
made me far from happy, as ye may aisily
imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the old boy himself seemed to be in
young Sidney, and before I knew it my heart was
in me mouth and I was almost yelling me lungs
out rootin&rsquo; for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He raced along in great bounds, and it
seemed to me as though each stride covered ten
feet. By the time they&rsquo;d made half the distance
he was right up to the &lsquo;ringer&rsquo;s&rsquo; shoulder, and
seemed to be goin&rsquo; faster each second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smith (or Castle, whichever you choose to
call him) gave a glance back, and let out every
bit o&rsquo; speed in him. For a second he drew away
from the kid, and I was almost ready to cry, I
was so disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Sidney was not the bye to be left behind,
and he put on full steam, so to speak. By now
everybody that was watchin&rsquo; the race was standin&rsquo;
on their ears with excitement, and when at the
seventy-five-yard mark Sidney drew right abreast
of this Smith chap I thought the whole field
would go wild. Pretty women an&rsquo; girls waved
their parasols and shrieked at the top o&rsquo; their
lungs, and as fer the men&mdash;well, they just went
plumb batty.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The other entries were practically out of the
race now, and were plugging along far in the
rear. The two leaders hit it up faster an&rsquo; faster,
till they were fairly flying. For all he was a
&lsquo;ringer,&rsquo; the Smith chap was game, and did his
best, I&rsquo;ll say that for him. But young Sidney
was a regular cyclone that day, and on the last
ten yards jumped ahead as though the other fellow
were standing still. It seemed to me he
cleared the last fifteen feet in one jump, and I&rsquo;ll
swear he was in the air when his breast broke
the ribbon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d won the race, all right, but he didn&rsquo;t
hear the applause that pretty nearly split the sky
in two. He just crumpled up like a wet rag, and
it was pretty near ten minutes before we could
bring him to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he did finally open his eyes, he happened
to look at me first, and he grinned weakly,
&lsquo;Well, Red, we trimmed the &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; good and
plenty, you and I, didn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; and he actually
shook hands with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me, boys, I was the happiest kid in
the State that day, bar none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Reddy stopped speaking, and gazed
ruminatively out over the ocean, with what
looked like a mist in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>After the athletes had discussed this story in
all its details, Bert asked, &ldquo;But what became of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the &lsquo;ringer,&rsquo; Reddy? What did they do to
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was nothing much we could do,&rdquo;
replied the trainer, &ldquo;but, believe me, it was an
awful knock to the college that put him up to it,
and I don&rsquo;t think they tried that trick for many
a long day afterward. Believe me, lads, crookedness
doesn&rsquo;t pay, in sport or in anything else.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Monster Peril</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The good ship <i>Northland</i> had been traveling
at reduced speed several hours, and Bert,
who was always intensely interested in the operation
of the vessel, was quick to notice this. At
supper time the speed had not increased, and
accordingly Bert took the first opportunity that
presented itself to ask the captain respectfully
the reason for this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
been receiving wireless messages recently that
there is considerable ice in these waters, and
we&rsquo;re going slowly in consequence. Of course,
at this time of the year, we oughtn&rsquo;t to have to
bother about icebergs at all, but the last winter
was very long and cold, and this is the result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Bert; &ldquo;but how do you know
when you&rsquo;re in the neighborhood of an iceberg?
I should imagine it would be a rather hard object
to make out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re wrong there,&rdquo; responded the captain.
&ldquo;They are very easy to see, as they emit a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pale sort of glimmer that makes them very prominent
at night. Of course, you never have any
difficulty locating them in the daytime, fortunately.
And then there&rsquo;s another thing: they always
chill the air for a considerable distance
around them, and any sailor can tell what is
threatening his ship when he feels this. Oh, no,
they are easy enough to avoid, as a rule. Of
course, sometimes a vessel running at high speed
will not get warning of the presence of the menace
until it is too late, as in a fog, for instance.
In that case there is generally a report of another
wreck in the morning papers a few days afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I should think there would be a way of
detecting them by means of some instrument,
say, for example, with an ordinary thermometer,&rdquo;
said Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, devices of that kind have been invented
and used,&rdquo; replied Captain Everett, &ldquo;but
in these days of high speed the warning generally
comes too late, unless the ship is steaming
at a very slow pace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, science has been able to find
nothing that is much better than the old method
of a watch up in the crow&rsquo;s nest. Is that the
idea?&rdquo; questioned Bert, in a disappointed tone.
He had great faith in the ability of mechanical
science to solve every problem under the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and accordingly he was incredulous on this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far that is true,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;but
a device has recently been patented that seems
to fill the bill perfectly, as far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does that work?&rdquo; queried Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to explain it, you would have to have
a rather exhaustive knowledge of icebergs and
their habits,&rdquo; said the captain, smiling; &ldquo;however,
I will do my best to make it clear to you.
You see, an iceberg, being so much colder than
the surrounding water, sets up a series of currents
in the ocean, that are felt for a considerable
distance. The warmer water flows toward the
&rsquo;berg, and the colder water away, just as in the
air the warmer air will rise and the colder air
rush in to take its place. Is that plain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, I can understand how that
works, all right,&rdquo; replied Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in that case, you can see how simple
the rest is,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;All you have to
do is construct an instrument that will be affected
by these currents, and your problem is solved.
Of course that is a comparatively simple matter,
and the writer of the article I read claimed to
have done it. His theory seemed very plausible
to me, and I would be very little surprised to see
every ship equipped with his device in the near
future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly seems feasible,&rdquo; agreed Bert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&ldquo;in fact, it seems so simple that it&rsquo;s queer someone
has not thought of it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing surprising in that, to my
way of thinking,&rdquo; said Captain Everett. &ldquo;Many
of our greatest inventions, or rather their principles,
existed long before they were put to practical
use. Take steam, for example. Steam has
existed from the beginning of the world, with all
its power and possibilities, yet it is not until a
comparatively recent date that it has been harnessed
and put to work. It&rsquo;s the same way with
electricity, or any of a thousand things you could
think of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no doubt but what you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
admitted Bert, &ldquo;but just the same, it seems too
bad they couldn&rsquo;t have been discovered sooner.
Look at the <i>Titanic</i> disaster, for instance. If
they had had that device that you were just telling
me about installed, the whole tragedy could
probably have been avoided, and the world been
spared a horrible disaster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly does seem a pity,&rdquo; agreed the
captain, &ldquo;but then, if everything had been discovered
right off, there would have been nothing
left for you or me to invent, and the world
would have no work left for anyone to do.
There seems to be a great plan back of these
things, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we haven&rsquo;t something of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
kind on board now,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;It might come
in handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised,&rdquo; said Captain
Everett, with a worried air. &ldquo;I hate to lose
valuable time crawling along at this pace, but of
course anything is better than what might happen
if we didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to cheat old Uncle
Sam out of a victory by drowning all his athletes,&rdquo;
and here he smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it would be a terrible loss,&rdquo; agreed Bert,
slyly, &ldquo;specially that of yours truly. That would
indeed be an irreparable calamity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, of course,&rdquo; laughed the captain.
&ldquo;That goes without saying, Wilson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Reddy strolled up, and joined in
the conversation. His thoughts, however, dwelt
more with perfecting a certain crowd of athletes
for the coming Olympic games than with inventions
to warn ships of their peril, or any other
kind.</p>

<p>After a time the captain asked Reddy how his
charges were coming along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, as well as could be expected, I suppose,&rdquo;
growled the trainer. Secretly he was more than
satisfied with their condition, but would have
died rather than admit it. &ldquo;They seem more
inclined to exercise their jaw muscles than anything
else, but otherwise they&rsquo;re not so awful
bad.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather negative praise,&rdquo; laughed
Bert, &ldquo;but we know very well that if we weren&rsquo;t
all right Reddy would be exercising his &lsquo;jaw
muscles&rsquo; more than he does, so we have to be
satisfied with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reddy grinned, but made no reply, and shortly
afterward sauntered off. After a little further
conversation with the captain, Bert followed suit,
and strolled up into the bows, where a man was
on lookout.</p>

<p>The sailor was gazing intently ahead, and did
not look up at the sound of Bert&rsquo;s approach, or
even when he spoke to him. He knew that the
safety of the whole ship and those on board
rested on him, and he was taking no chances.</p>

<p>He answered Bert&rsquo;s salutation civilly enough,
however, but answered his questions only in
monosyllables, and Bert soon gave him up as a
bad job. He realized, moreover, that the man
was right, as it was against the ship&rsquo;s rules to
talk while on duty.</p>

<p>So Bert leaned against the bulwarks in silence,
having little else to do at the time, and gazed
ahead in an abstracted fashion. No sound was
to be heard save the wash of the water against
the bows, and occasionally a shout or laugh from
the athletes amidships.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bert was roused from his reverie by
a call from the lookout.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ice ahead! Ice ahead!&rdquo; yelled the sailor,
and dashed madly toward the stern, waving his
arms wildly.</p>

<p>Bert gazed intently ahead, and could faintly
make out a luminous mass some distance from
the ship, but directly in its path. He was conscious
of a feeling of damp chill in the air, too,
and felt that they were nearing an iceberg. Suddenly
the vibration of the engines ceased, and
then started again, and Bert knew they had been
reversed. The ship seemed to lose little of its
speed at first, though, and the huge &rsquo;berg loomed
up closer and closer. The helm had been put
over, and the ship swung around obediently, and
so approached the &rsquo;berg at an angle. Shouts and
cries arose from the crew and some of the passengers,
and it was an exciting moment.</p>

<p>Gradually the ship lost its momentum under
the reverse pull of the big propellers, but to Bert
it seemed impossible that they could stop in time.
Nearer and nearer they came, and the ship
seemed wrapped in an icy fog. Now Bert could
make out details of the &rsquo;berg, and even in such a
time as this, when it seemed that he was approaching
certain death, he noted idly the huge
spires and needles of ice that rose into the blue
sky like church steeples.</p>

<p>Now the good ship was almost touching the
&rsquo;berg, but was at a long angle with it. Bert saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that the impact would not be as great as he had
at first imagined, but nevertheless he awaited it
with bated breath.</p>

<p>Then it came&mdash;a jarring, grinding, glancing
blow, and the ship trembled from bow to stern.
Huge fragments of ice clattered down on her
decks, and some of her crew were badly hurt by
flying ice splinters.</p>

<p>There was great confusion then, and a few of
the crew started a rush for the boats, but were
met before they could get there by Captain Everett
and his first and second officers, all with revolvers
in their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back there! Back!&rdquo; shouted the captain,
and his ordinarily mild eyes blazed with an angry
light. &ldquo;The first man who moves another step
forward dies! Get back to your posts, every
one of you, and be glad I don&rsquo;t shoot you like
the dogs you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cowed by his determined demeanor, and that
of the other officers, the men slunk back, and
Captain Everett set about finding what damage
had been done. Two sailors were sent below to
inspect the hold, and the captain awaited their
report with keen anxiety.</p>

<p>Soon the two men returned, and one said:
&ldquo;There seems to be nothing the matter, sir, as
far as we can make out. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to be
taking in any water.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, after
the two men had saluted and gone forward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
barely possible that the ship may not be much
damaged, after all, although it seems almost incredible.
However, we won&rsquo;t find any fault with
providence if it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, by what appeared to
be almost a miracle the ship had come off from
the encounter with a few bent bow plates and the
loss of considerable paint.</p>

<p>Before long the ship had resumed its course,
and the iceberg was falling rapidly to the rear.
Bert had been the only person in the vessel&rsquo;s bows
at the time of the collision, and he was soon encircled
by a group of athletes anxious to hear the
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me, fellows,&rdquo; he said, in a sober
voice, &ldquo;I gave us all up for lost. I thought our
goose had been cooked, sure. Why, that &rsquo;berg
looked as high as a mountain to me, and if we
had hit it head-on it would have been all over
but the shouting. It&rsquo;s a lucky thing the captain
got warning in time to veer the steamer around
a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody realized that they had had a very
close escape from death, and for the rest of the
day little else was talked about. It was just such
a collision as had been responsible for the speedy
sinking of the great liner <i>Titanic</i> with over two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thousand souls on board. That ship had struck
a glancing blow, in the same way that the <i>Northland</i>
had, but was less fortunate as to the result.
A great projecting sliver of ice had penetrated
the ill-fated vessel&rsquo;s hull, and within a few hours
she was lying at the bottom of the sea. Indeed,
at the present moment they were but a short distance
from the leviathan&rsquo;s last resting place, and
this made them realize all the more strongly what
a miraculous escape they had had.</p>

<p>Needless to say, every precaution was taken to
insure against a repetition of their recent experience,
and the ship fairly crawled along at one-quarter
speed. They sighted other &rsquo;bergs at intervals,
but never near enough to give them any
concern, and a day or so later were safely out
of the danger zone. Then Captain Everett ordered
full speed resumed, and the <i>Northland</i>
began to plow through the blue water at its customary
good clip.</p>

<p>Training, which had been more or less interrupted
by the recent exciting events, was resumed
in good earnest, and everybody worked with a
will to make up for lost time. Reddy had an eye
for every athlete on board, and woe betide the
man who was found shirking, even in the slightest
degree. He was sure to be forced to make up his
deficiencies, with some extra hard training
&ldquo;stunt&rdquo; for good measure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The second day after the encounter with the
iceberg the sky became very overcast, and bore
every sign of an approaching storm. The haze
veiling the heavens became thicker and thicker,
and the sun could be seen shining through it only
at rare intervals, and then very faintly.</p>

<p>The barometer fell lower and lower, and there
was every evidence of the approach of a severe
storm. Nor were these warnings groundless, as
they soon had occasion to find out.</p>

<p>Everything aboard ship was made ready, and
no movable object on the decks was left unsecured.
The athletes regarded the approach of
the storm with feelings more of interest than anything
else, but Reddy snorted his disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;This
trip so far has been nothin&rsquo; but a bunch o&rsquo; queer
experiences that you could write a story book
about, maybe, but that don&rsquo;t count for more than
a plugged nickel when it comes to gettin&rsquo; a bunch
o&rsquo; would-be athletes in shape to make better speed
than the runners at a fat men&rsquo;s picnic. I just get
things settled down and begin to kid meself that
we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; somewhere, when we go and bump
into an iceberg, or some other fool stunt o&rsquo; that
kind. But if these fellers don&rsquo;t cop a few lovin&rsquo;
cups and medals over at the games it isn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to be the iceberg that gets the blame, you can lay
to that. Nix! Everybody&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Gee, I bet old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s runners and jumpers would have
made good if only they&rsquo;d had a decent sort of a
trainer along that knew a little about his job.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s the line of chatter that&rsquo;ll be handed out
to me, all right. This trainin&rsquo; business is a thankless
job, anyway, let me tell you. If the American
team wins, they get all the glory and credit, but
if they lose, it&rsquo;s yours truly that gets the blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t you worry yourself about us,
Reddy,&rdquo; said Drake, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to win every
event over there, practically, and after watching
our wonderful work you ought to realize that
fact,&rdquo; and he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; replied Reddy, sarcastically. &ldquo;If
you boys win all you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to win,
I won&rsquo;t kick. But I&rsquo;m from the wilds of Missouri,
and I&rsquo;ve got to be shown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discussion of this sort lasted until the lunch bell
rang, when there was a wild dive to the tables,
all disputes forgotten.</p>

<p>After lunch, when they returned on deck, they
were surprised at the appearance of the ocean.
The wind, which before they went below had
been blowing in fitful gusts, had now settled
down to a steady gale that was increasing in violence
with every hour that passed. The sea was
rising rapidly, and already was dotted here and
there with whitecaps. The sun had entirely disappeared,
and the sky was a dull gray color.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Clouds scudded across it with terrific speed, giving
an indication of the force of the wind back
of them, and as the boys gazed across the tumbling
waves they every one felt a thrill of something
very much like apprehension.</p>

<p>There is something very terrifying and awe-compelling
about a storm at sea, especially to
those not used to it. At such time a ship seems
a very small thing in the great expanse of tumbling
billows and shrieking wind, and it seems
almost impossible that anything constructed by
man can withstand Nature&rsquo;s fury.</p>

<p>Soon the storm became so wild that most of
the passengers retired below, and many of them
experienced sea-sickness for the first time on the
voyage, as the ship was now pitching and rolling
wildly. Bert, Dick and Tom, however, stayed on
deck, and felt that nothing could hire them to go
down. This was an experience such as they might
not have again in many a year, and they felt inclined
to make the most of it.</p>

<p>They stayed on deck until supper time, and
then went below. Several athletes were absent
from the tables, and of those who were there
many ate very sparingly. Not one would admit
that this was due to sea-sickness, however, and
indeed, there was less of this than might naturally
have been expected.</p>

<p>They were all in such fine physical condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that they were less affected by such an experience
than the average passenger, and there were few
of them who were actually &ldquo;down and out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The storm lasted two days, but on the morning
of the third day had practically blown itself out.
When the three comrades went up on deck the
sun was shining gloriously, but the ocean was still
very rough. In a few hours it had subsided noticeably,
but the great billows still ran fifteen or
twenty feet high. It was a wonderful sight, and
one to be remembered for a lifetime. The boys
gazed spellbound, and felt they would have been
contented to do nothing all day but drink in the
inspiring scene.</p>

<p>Shortly after they got on deck the lookout
cried, &ldquo;Ship ho!&rdquo; and the boys followed the
direction of his pointing finger. At first they
could make out nothing, but in a few minutes they
glimpsed a vessel lifted up on the crest of a
monster wave, and about a mile from their
course.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer it became evident that the
vessel was a partial or entire wreck. She had
been a three-masted schooner, as they could tell
from the stumps of the masts projecting from her
deck, but they had all gone by the board.</p>

<p>One was still fastened to the ship by a mass
of tangled rigging, and every once in a while
would be washed against the side with a crash.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The vessel was low in the water, and it was evident
that she was sinking.</p>

<p>The <i>Northland&rsquo;s</i> course was altered so as to
bring her alongside the dismantled vessel, and
the athletes, every one of whom by this time was
on deck, crowded to the rail, to get a closer
glimpse of the wreck.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ocean&rsquo;s Prey</span></h3>


<p class="cap">It was indeed a scene of awful wreckage on
which they gazed. The gale had played
havoc with the unfortunate vessel, and what with
the aid of the mighty waves had almost completely
demolished it. The bulwarks were battered
and broken, where the masts had crushed
them in falling overboard. Broken and splintered
planks strewed the deck, and everything
was bound together by tangled masses of cordage.
The bridge had been torn from its fastenings at
one end, and sagged down to the deck. All the
davits were empty, with the exception of two in
which boats were still hanging. The reason for
this was plain, as they both had huge holes stove
in their planking, and could not possibly have
been repaired in less than several days.</p>

<p>Altogether it presented a sad spectacle, and
bore mute testimony to the terrific violence of
the storm through which they had just passed.
There was no sign of life on board, but nevertheless
Captain Everett decided to send a boat
to investigate, on the off chance of picking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
some wounded or sick person who might have
been overlooked in the last mad launching of the
boats.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a boat was lowered, and certain
members of the crew told off to man her.
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, who with Dick, Bert,
and most of the other athletes, was an interested
spectator of these proceedings, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;bout
ten years of my life to be able to go with them.
I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any chance of that,
though, hang it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a chance in the world,&rdquo; replied Bert, but
then he hesitated a minute, and said, &ldquo;But wait,
hold on a minute. I may be able to get us on,
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo; questioned
Dick, incredulously, but already Bert was making
a bee-line for the captain.</p>

<p>When he could get Captain Everett&rsquo;s attention
he asked to be allowed to visit the wreck with his
two companions. At first he would not even
listen, but Bert begged so hard that he finally
consented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered, rather dubiously,
&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to let you go, but just the
same I wish you had asked some other favor.
However, I don&rsquo;t suppose any very great harm
can come from it, so you have my permission,
Wilson. I am trusting you to be careful and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
endanger the lives of you or your two companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;and you may
rest assured that we will take every precaution,&rdquo;
and Bert turned and raced back to his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, fellows!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;The
captain says we can go, and everything&rsquo;s settled.
Make out I&rsquo;m not the champion little fixer of this
crowd of rescuing heroes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sure are,&rdquo; admitted Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to hand it to you. But tell us the magic word.
Let us in on the secret, and tell us how you did
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it later on,&rdquo; replied
Bert. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time now, because they&rsquo;re
holding the boat for us as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Everett, true to his promise, had given
orders to the crew to take the three comrades
with them, and they awaited their arrival with
much impatience. They had not long to wait,
however, for in another few seconds the three
had raced across the deck at a pace that did
credit to their training, and tumbled into the boat.
Then the sailors gave way with a will.</p>

<p>The graceful boat fairly flew over the ocean,
which by this time had become much smoother.
Occasionally some wave higher than the rest
would dash against the sides and send a silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
shower of spray over them, and without careful
seamanship it would have been no very difficult
matter to swamp the frail craft.</p>

<p>However, they reached the wreck without mishap,
and then the question arose as to the best
way to board the hulk. The splintered mast
washing against the side of the ship nearest to
their own vessel made it impossible to land on
that side, so they rowed around under the stern
of the wreck. Here her name was printed in
prominent black letters: the <i>Mary Carpenter</i>, of
New York. Continuing to the other side, they
had small difficulty in picking up a trailing rope
and making their little boat fast. Then, one
after the other, they went up the rope hand over
hand until all the crew were on the littered deck
with the exception of one sailor who was left to
take care of the boat. The boys had no choice
but to follow suit, but they tackled the feat with
many misgivings. It is not as easy a thing as
it may sound to climb hand over hand up a slippery
cable, with a seething ocean below, and the
ship to which the rope is attached jerking and
plunging in every direction. Fortunately, their
nerve and good training enabled them to negotiate
the perilous passage without accident, and
they were soon standing on the deck of the wreck.</p>

<p>Mr. Pollard, the officer commanding the expedition,
led the way, picking his way over piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and tumbled wreckage that told its own story of
storm and destruction.</p>

<p>He made directly for the cabin, followed by
the others. As they neared it they could distinguish
a muffled barking, and Dick exclaimed,
&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that, fellows!
They&rsquo;ve left in such a hurry that they&rsquo;ve left
their dog behind. It begins to look as though
we might have a chance to rescue something, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it, though?&rdquo; said Tom, and the boys
could hardly restrain their eagerness to break
open the door imprisoning the unfortunate animal.</p>

<p>They were not long in reaching it, but found
the door blocked, apparently by some heavy object
inside. Several of the sailors set their
brawny shoulders against the door, however, and
it burst inward with a crash. From the opening
dashed a big white bulldog, running full tilt
into Tom and fairly knocking him off his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, as
he picked himself up, &ldquo;what hit me anyway?
Was it an elephant, or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the others could recover from their
laughter, they began making overtures to the
dog, who had rushed up into the bows and now
regarded them suspiciously. &ldquo;Poor old fellow,&rdquo;
said Bert, &ldquo;I guess he thought the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the world had come, or something equally bad.
He doesn&rsquo;t seem to like our looks very much
now, though, does he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he does, he conceals his feelings very
successfully,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;He may become better
tempered, though, when he sees that we&rsquo;re
trying to introduce ourselves properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the dog seemed more frightened than
vicious, and presently began to wag his tail
feebly. After much coaxing he came toward
them, and Bert ventured to pat his head. The
dog licked his hand affectionately, and wagged
his tail, or what he called his tail, as hard as he
knew how. &ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; said Bert, seized by
a sudden inspiration, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take him back with
us and make him our mascot. I have a feeling
that he&rsquo;ll bring us all the luck in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great idea,&rdquo; agreed Tom and Dick, and
adopted the ship-wrecked one forthwith. The
suggestion of a sailor that he hadn&rsquo;t brought
much luck to the vessel on which he was found fell
on deaf ears, and the boys returned to the search
of the ship, followed unquestioningly by their
latest acquisition.</p>

<p>Inside the dark cabin everything was in a confused
state fitly matching that of objects outside.
The berths were tumbled, and the bed-coverings
were strewn about the floor. A small iron safe
set in flush with the wall was open, and empty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
A few stray coins were scattered here and there
about the floor, and the first comers pounced
eagerly on these, to save as souvenirs. A further
search failed to reveal the ship&rsquo;s log or any
of her papers, but of course this was not to be
wondered at, as only in a case of the most dire
peril will a commander leave his vessel without
these.</p>

<p>There were three other state-rooms opening out
of the main cabin, but after they had been
thoroughly ransacked nothing of any value was
found in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, men,&rdquo; said Mr. Pollard, &ldquo;I guess
there&rsquo;s no use in staying here any longer. Evidently
there&rsquo;s no living soul on board, and as
far as I can see there seems to be nothing worth
taking away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, after one last glance around the
forlorn cabin, they had turned and were preparing
to go on deck, when they were startled by a
shout from above and the man who had been left
to take care of the small boat poked his shaggy
head inside the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better make haste, sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
in an excited voice, addressing Mr. Pollard, &ldquo;this
old tub&rsquo;s settling fast, sir, and I think she&rsquo;s about
due to go under in something less than a quarter
of an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly Mr. Pollard gave the order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
return to their boat, but the words had hardly
left his mouth when the wreck gave a sickening
lunge, and the face of more than one in the little
party went pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step lively, now, men!&rdquo; ordered the officer,
in a tense voice. He had no need to repeat
his order, for the ship began to list over at a
sharp angle, and the men broke into a run. The
sight that met their eyes as they leaped up the
stairs to the deck was terrifying. When they
had gone below, the deck had been perhaps four
feet above the water, but now it was almost level
with the waves at its highest part, and where it
had listed over the water was lapping above the
boards.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the sailors, and they
made a wild dash for the boat. Into it they
tumbled, pell mell, and last of all came the three
boys and Mr. Pollard. They leaped into the
boat without selecting their landing place very
carefully, and those nearest the oars snatched
them up and began pulling for dear life. They
were not in unison, however, and the boat fairly
crawled away from the side of the doomed vessel.
It seemed like some horrible nightmare, in
which deadly peril is seen approaching, but from
which the sleeper is unable to escape. Fortunately,
both Dick and Bert had managed to get
hold of an oar on opposite sides of the boat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they at least kept their heads and worked together.</p>

<p>They knew that if the wreck sank before they
got one or two hundred feet from it, the whole
boat load would be drawn under by the suction.
They tugged and pulled desperately, and gradually,
aided to some extent by the cooler of the
crew, drew away from the dangerous vicinity.
In their excitement they had forgotten the poor
dog, but now they were reminded of his presence
by seeing him come to a broken place in the bulwarks
and gaze after them with beseeching barks
and whines.</p>

<p>Dick looked at Bert, but the latter shook his
head. &ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t take a chance and go back
for him, Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be staking all
our lives against that of a dog. We&rsquo;ll have to
leave him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, but I hate to do that,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
&ldquo;maybe we can get him to follow us,&rdquo; and he
started whistling to the dog.</p>

<p>The animal seemed uncertain what to do, but
after giving one despairing glance around at the
dismantled deck, he appeared to make up his
mind, and plunged boldly overboard. Those in
the boat would have liked to wait for him, but
they dare not. They were not yet at a safe distance,
and the wreck was going down fast now.
She was listed considerably to port, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
could see the waves washing further and further
up the sloping deck.</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, the unfortunate schooner settled,
causing little ripples and eddies in the water
surrounding it, which by this time was almost
calm. Now almost half the deck was under
water, and then the stern gradually rose in the
air, while the bows pointed downward into the
green depths. Slowly, deliberately, she slid under
the waves, and one more proud ship was
added to the ocean&rsquo;s heavy toll.</p>

<p>A deep sigh went up from those in the little
boat, partly of thankfulness at their own escape,
and partly of sorrow over the fate of the wrecked
schooner.</p>

<p>The poor bull dog had disappeared, and the
boys gave him up for lost. Suddenly Tom cried,
&ldquo;Look, fellows, look! He must have been
dragged under by the suction, but I just saw him
come up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, over the spot where the ship
had gone down they could see a little white speck
bobbing up and down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give way, men!&rdquo; ordered Mr. Pollard, &ldquo;we
might as well pick the plucky little scamp up.
It&rsquo;s easy to see <i>he&rsquo;s</i> no quitter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men were nothing loth, and were soon
alongside the game little swimmer. Tom leaned
over the side, and grasping him by the scruff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
his neck, pulled him safely inboard. The dog
feebly licked his hand, but then lay in a little
dejected heap in the bottom of the boat, panting
heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old sport, fate has certainly been handing
you a rather rough deal lately, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
asked Bert, addressing the dog, and was answered
by a faint wag of the stubby tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give him a name, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Dick, &ldquo;what shall we call him fellows?
Suggest something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a serious matter, for of course a
mascot has got to have an appropriate name.
&lsquo;Sport,&rsquo; &lsquo;Nero,&rsquo; &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; and many others were
proposed, but were finally rejected in favor of
Bingo, which had a college flavor and seemed to
suit him very well.</p>

<p>By the time this question had been settled they
had reached the <i>Northland</i>, and were soon on
board. Last of all Bingo was hoisted over the
side, and introduced to the assembled athletes
as the team mascot. He was received with the
greatest enthusiasm, and immediately proceeded
to make friends with everybody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought we&rsquo;d clean things up at the
Olympics,&rdquo; remarked Drake, &ldquo;but now I feel
more certain of it than ever. The only thing
we lacked is now supplied. I must confess, now
that the trial is past, that having no mascot has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
kept me awake many a night and seriously affected
my appetite,&rdquo; he said, with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, if anything has been affecting your appetite,
Drake,&rdquo; said one of the others, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to see you when you were in first class shape and
could really eat. I think this bally old hooker
would be out of grub in less than a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s right, pick on me, just because
I&rsquo;m small and weak,&rdquo; grinned Drake, who
was something like six feet two inches tall, and
weighed a hundred and ninety-five pounds, &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you go and get some poor victim of your
own size once in a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, it must be awful to be feeble and puny
the way you are, Drake,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;you
certainly do arouse my pity. What you need is
a tonic to build you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Tom, &ldquo;poor Drake&rsquo;s fading
fast. All he could do to-day was to throw
the discus a measly little hundred and thirty
feet and a fraction. That sure is an indication
of falling powers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve noticed how he&rsquo;s weakening,&rdquo; remarked
Axtell. &ldquo;Why, he hasn&rsquo;t got anything
at all on that discus except a mile a minute speed
and a world of strength. Otherwise he&rsquo;s certainly
all in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drake stood all this chaffing with a good natured
grin, for he was in such good condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that he could afford to have people joke about it.
He had been doing better and better all the time,
and nobody on board had the slightest doubt that
he would break all records at the coming Olympic.</p>

<p>He was really a marvel of strength, but some
of the sailors on board, while they admitted that
&ldquo;the big guy could sure throw that plate around&rdquo;
still believed that at least one of their number
had the &lsquo;goods&rsquo; on him. They pinned their
faith on a big, red haired Irishman of their number,
who had won fame in many a rough and
tumble battle, and swore that no &lsquo;college guy&rsquo;
who ever lived could throw him. The athletes
had equal faith in Drake, however, and knew that
he had at one time taken considerable interest
in scientific wrestling. This fact, combined with
his phenomenal strength, made them certain he
could throw the big sailor.</p>

<p>For some time there had been considerable
controversy between the athletes and the crew, all
in a good natured strain, however. The sailors
were anxious to pit their champion against Drake,
but the latter had felt that such a contest would
interfere with his training, and so had held off.</p>

<p>That morning, however, the big Irish sailor
had made a vaunting remark that had &ldquo;gotten
Drake&rsquo;s goat,&rdquo; and made the big fellow resolve
to bring matters to an issue once and for all.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>He confided his resolve to Bert and a few
chosen pals, and they were glad to hear it, for
the crew had all along adopted a skeptical attitude
toward the athletes, and referred to them
more than once as the &ldquo;college kids.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly they decided to challenge the big
sailor that very night, and Dick was intrusted
with the task. They decided to meet the man
(Donahue by name), on his own terms, so that
afterward the sailors could have no possible
grounds of complaint.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan Dick went forward
to the sailors&rsquo; quarters immediately after supper,
and found Donahue and some of his friends lying
in their berths smoking black clay pipes and swapping
yarns, as was their custom off watch, when
they felt strong enough to stand the strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And phwat&rsquo;s the matter now, young felly?&rdquo;
inquired Donahue, when he saw Dick coming
down the ladder. &ldquo;Sit down awhile and make
yersilf comfortable. I was jist goin&rsquo; to tell my
mates o&rsquo; the time Oi was wrecked on a cannibal
island an&rsquo; married the chief&rsquo;s daughter, an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here Dick interrupted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I won&rsquo;t have time to listen just now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come from my friend Drake (the discus
thrower, you know), and he wants me to say
that he thinks he can throw the best wrestler
you&rsquo;ve got here, bar none.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he does, does he?&rdquo; growled Donahue,
&ldquo;all right, me bye, you just go back and tell
him that Oi&rsquo;m ready for him any minute of the
day, or night too fer that matter. How does he
want to run the match? Under a lot o&rsquo; fancy
rules, Oi suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on your tintype,&rdquo; replied Dick, warmly,
&ldquo;this is to be catch as catch can, and the best
man wins. You haven&rsquo;t any objection to that,
have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Divil a bit,&rdquo; said the sailor, &ldquo;thim terms
suits me all right. What do ye say mates?
When shall we run off the match?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would be the matter with to-morrow
evening right after supper?&rdquo; inquired Dick,
&ldquo;you might as well take your licking then as any
other time, Donahue, and get the agony over
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lickin&rsquo;, is ut?&rdquo; said the big Irishman,
grimly. &ldquo;Lickin&rsquo; it may be, but it won&rsquo;t be me
as gets it, you can lay to that. Bring on your
man after supper to-morrow evenin&rsquo; at about
this time, and Oi&rsquo;ll stretch me muscles a little before
goin&rsquo; to sleep. Me heart&rsquo;s full o&rsquo; pity for
your man, though. It seems a shame to do ut,&rdquo;
and he grinned and gave a tremendous and elaborate
yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;only
if you&rsquo;ve got any sympathy to spare, I&rsquo;d advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
saving it for your own private use. You&rsquo;ll need
plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; replied Donahue,
and after settling a few more details Dick left.</p>

<p>Returning to his companions, he acquainted
them with the result of his mission, and Drake
expressed himself as perfectly satisfied with the
conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t anticipate much trouble,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no doubt but what that harp is
pretty strong, but its simply a matter of muscle
against brain, and muscle doesn&rsquo;t usually make
out very well in that case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you&rsquo;ve got to be mighty careful,&rdquo;
warned Dick. &ldquo;That sailor is one of the strongest
men I ever saw, and is capable of giving you
a good deal of trouble. I&rsquo;ll be much surprised
if he doesn&rsquo;t give you a mighty hard tussle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt that for a minute,&rdquo; replied
Drake, &ldquo;still I think I have the goods on him.
We won&rsquo;t have to wait very long to find out,
that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little further discussion in the same
vein the boys dispersed for the night.</p>

<p>Of course, Reddy had gathered a pretty good
idea of what was going forward, and at first he
had decided to interfere, but later changed his
mind. &ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t hurt the boy,&rdquo; he reflected,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s tough as a piece of armor plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and it may do him good to give his muscles a
good work out. There&rsquo;s nothing like a little excitement
once in a while to tone a man up and put
him in the pink of condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly Reddy &ldquo;winked his other eye,&rdquo;
as the saying goes, and let the boys go on with
their preparations unmolested.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Husky Antagonist</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The next day passed quietly, and the athletes
spent it profitably in unbroken training exercises,
and Reddy felt that they were rounding
into form in a manner to suit even his critical
eye. He watched the runners circling the track,
the jumpers practising, and last, but not least,
the discus and hammer throwers hurling the
heavy weights from the stern of the ship. His
sharp eye watched Drake&rsquo;s performance with
particular care, but the latter showed no sign of
concern over the coming contest, and laughed
and joked with the others as though nothing unusual
were in the wind. At his last attempt he
gave an unusually savage heave to the heavy
disc, and it sailed far out over the shining, sparkling
water. The cord attached to it whizzed
through the air, and when pulled in the plate
was found to have traveled one hundred and
thirty-two feet flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Drake. That&rsquo;s the kind of
stuff I want to see!&rdquo; exclaimed the trainer, and
Drake flushed a little with pleasure. Reddy gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
so little praise that when he did speak well of
any performance his words had a double value.
Which was perhaps his object. Who knows?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Drake, &ldquo;but I guess I&rsquo;ll rest on my laurels now,
and take it easy the rest of the day. I&rsquo;ll bet any
money that before we get to Berlin I&rsquo;ll be crowding
the record for all its worth, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, maybe so,&rdquo; growled Reddy, who
seemed to regret his praise, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got to
keep plugging, and plugging hard, if you expect
to do it. That&rsquo;s the trouble with a lot of athletes,
and a good many others who aren&rsquo;t athletes;
they quit just when the goal&rsquo;s in sight,
and lose all their effort for nothing. It&rsquo;s usually
the last few yards of a race that are the hardest,
and it&rsquo;s then that the quitting streak shows up in
a lot of people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to quit,&rdquo; said Drake,
a little resentfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, me boy,&rdquo; replied Reddy, in a
softer voice. &ldquo;Me little sermon wasn&rsquo;t meant
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the hammer throwers created a diversion
here, by getting his string tangled in the
bulwarks, and not noticing it until he had hurled
the heavy missile. Before it had traveled half
its distance it reached the end of the cord, which
snapped like a cobweb under the weight. &ldquo;Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
night,&rdquo; exclaimed the thrower, gazing ruefully at
the frazzled end of the cord as it whipped inboard,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a hammer gone to visit Davy
Jones, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; laughed Tom, who was sitting near,
&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t hit the old gentleman on the
head. He may not appreciate the gift, if it did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him much for feeling
peeved,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t be the most
comfortable thing in the world to have that drop
in on you unexpected-like. I think the old sport
would have right on his side, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right, Dick,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;and
I think that to atone for the insult we ought to
throw old Snyder overboard. What do you
think, fellows? It might keep Dave from
wreaking his vengeance on the whole ship. A
stitch in time saves nine, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Overboard with him,&rdquo; yelled the laughing
group, but Drake held up his hand in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to forget, fellows,&rdquo; he said, in a
solemn voice, &ldquo;that as yet we&rsquo;re not absolutely
certain that the old gentleman has been hit. I
suggest, therefore, that we spare Snyder until
Mr. Jones calls for him in person. Then we
will hand him over without protest, of course, in
fact, gladly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose we might as well postpone
the pleasure, seeing that you suggest it,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
said Bert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big disappointment, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the boys solemnly agreed to spare
Snyder&rsquo;s life for the time being, and the baited
hammer thrower went forward to get a new
hammer from the reserve supply.</p>

<p>He soon returned, and this time was more
careful of his string before letting fly. He
showed well in the practice, and Reddy was well
pleased with his work. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he
thought to himself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s getting slowly better
all the time, and that&rsquo;s what I like to see. These
&lsquo;phenoms&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t all they&rsquo;re cracked up to be.
They show up well for a while, and then like as
not they go all to pieces. I&rsquo;ll take a chance on
a good, steady, hard working man every time.
They&rsquo;re the ones you can count on in the pinches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Practice went on without further interruption
until lunch time, and everybody did ample justice
to the well cooked meal. The constant exercise,
combined with the invigorating sea air, gave them
appetites that it took much to satisfy, and which
caused wondering comment in the galley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zey eat more zan I zink possible,&rdquo; the little
French chef had exclaimed at the beginning of
the voyage, with uplifted hands. &ldquo;I cook an&rsquo;
cook, and still zey have not too much. Mon
Dieu! Zey will drive me&mdash;wat you call heem&mdash;bughouse.
Eet is no wondaire zey are strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one way the little cook was not displeased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
however, for at any rate he could complain of
no lack of appreciation of his cooking.</p>

<p>After everything had been demolished the
athletes repaired to the deck, and did whatever
pleased them for a couple of hours. Some
played deck games, while others were content
to read or gaze out idly over the sparkling blue
ocean. The weather was ideal, and since the
storm that had wrecked the schooner hardly a
cloud had appeared in the sky. Bingo appreciated
the fair weather immensely, and began to
get his looks back, which had suffered somewhat
under his recent hardships. He was now firmly
intrenched in the affections of every athlete on
board, and had been accepted unreservedly as
their mascot.</p>

<p>He was friendly with everybody, but his real
affection seemed divided between Bert, Tom and
Dick. He always followed them around, and
evidently considered them his especial guardians,
as they had been his rescuers.</p>

<p>They in turn saw that he had plenty to eat,
and made a great pet of him generally. He
seemed to take a deep interest in everything that
went on, and would watch the boys training with
the wisest look imaginable on his doggish face.</p>

<p>This particular afternoon he was not in sight,
however, when Dick and Bert went to hunt up
Drake. They found him finally, stretched out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a steamer chair, and reading a book as though
he had nothing in the world on his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, fellows, and take a load off your
feet,&rdquo; he said, as Bert and Dick came up, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
the good word this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing particular doing,&rdquo; replied
Bert, as he took his seat on the edge of
the rail, balancing back and forth with the motion
of the ship at imminent risk of being spilled
into the ocean, &ldquo;it seems like the calm preceding
the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By storm meaning to-night, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Drake smiling, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not worrying about it,
so why should you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we don&rsquo;t need to, in that
case,&rdquo; replied Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you feel so sure
about it, though. Do you feel in good shape?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never better in my life,&rdquo; replied Drake,
with a tremendous yawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just debating
in my mind whether to kill this audacious seaman
or just put him on the sick list for a week or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, you just about hate yourself, don&rsquo;t you
Drake?&rdquo; asked Bert, and they all laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same you want to be watching all
the time,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;the way this fellow is
used to wrestling, everything goes, and you want
to look out for fouls. That&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s
worrying me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied Drake, &ldquo;I used to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
lessons from a man who knew the game backward,
fair tricks and foul. He taught me a lot
while I was with him, and I guess I&rsquo;ll know what
to expect. And fore-warned is fore-armed, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was all I was afraid of,&rdquo; said
Bert. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt in the world that you
are more than a match for him when it comes to
straight wrestling. I&rsquo;m not so awfully flabby
myself, but I know you always manage to put
me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s out of your line,&rdquo;
replied Drake, &ldquo;mere brute strength doesn&rsquo;t
count so very much in wrestling. It&rsquo;s like boxing,
or baseball, or anything else; it&rsquo;s head work
that is the deciding factor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, old sock, get to it then,&rdquo; said Bert,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid to eat plenty of beef steak
for supper to-night. That&rsquo;s the stuff will pull
you through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; returned Drake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all
right, all-right. There&rsquo;ll be nothing to it, take
it from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what we like to hear,&rdquo; said Bert,
reassured as he and Dick strolled away. They
could talk of little else the rest of the afternoon,
and became more and more excited as the appointed
time drew near. At supper their usual
appetites were not in evidence, and for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
time since they left port they failed to give the
excellent meal the attention it deserved.</p>

<p>Supper despatched, they hunted up Drake, and
together with Tom talked with him until it was
close to eight o&rsquo;clock. Then they walked forward,
and descended to the seamen&rsquo;s quarters.
At intervals other athletes, who had been &lsquo;let in&rsquo;
on the secret, kept dropping in, until a goodly
company had arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ye&rsquo;re on toime, Oi see,&rdquo; remarked
Donahue, &ldquo;and how do ye feel, youngster?&rdquo; addressing
Drake. &ldquo;Are ye ready to have yer back
broke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the same as you are, I guess,&rdquo; replied
Drake, nonchalantly, and his companions grinned.
It was evident that their candidate was without
fear, at any rate.</p>

<p>The preliminaries were soon arranged, and
Drake and the sailor faced each other at opposite
extremities of a cleared space perhaps twenty
feet square. Bert had been selected to act as second
for Drake, and a big Swede, Olsen by name,
had been nominated as Donahue&rsquo;s second. Both
Drake and the sailor were dressed in gray flannel
shirts and short athletic trunks, and under
this thin covering their splendid physical development
could be plainly seen.</p>

<p>Donahue&rsquo;s muscles were knotted and bunched,
while Drake&rsquo;s lay flatter and were much less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
prominent. To the untrained eye the sailor
seemed much the stronger of the two, but Bert
knew better. Otherwise they were much the
same height and weight, and there seemed little
to choose between them.</p>

<p>The referee gave the starting signal, and
Drake and the seaman approached each other
warily, each stepping lightly as a cat. In spite
of their boasting before the contest, each man
realized that he would have all he could do to
win, and they were careful accordingly. At first
they circled agilely round and round, each seeking
for a favorable opening. Suddenly Drake
sprang in, but before he could secure the hold he
wanted, the nimble sailor had leaped aside, and
for a few seconds they stood looking at each
other. Then the wary circling began again, but
this time it was Donahue who rushed in. He
was more fortunate than Drake, and secured a
hold. Drake also got a good grip on him, however,
and for a moment they stood quiet, gathering
their strength for the real struggle. Then
with a sudden giant heave Donahue sought to
lift his adversary off his feet, but Drake was as
supple as a snake, and with a convulsive movement
tore himself out of the sailor&rsquo;s grasp and
sprang free. Donahue was after him in a trice,
and again they grappled, but this time it was
Drake who got the better hold. With a heave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and a lunge he lifted his giant opponent entirely
clear of the floor, and sent him crashing down on
his side. He followed up his advantage like a
flash, but in spite of his great bulk the sailor was
very quick, and had recovered somewhat, so that,
try as he might, Drake was unable to put him on
his back. Finally he was forced to give up the attempt,
and the seaman sprang to his feet. They
were about to engage again when the referee
stepped in and declared a short time for rest.
Both men were panting heavily, and were evidently
in need of it.</p>

<p>They retired to their respective sides of the
square, and Bert anxiously asked Drake if he felt
all right. &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; responded the latter,
&ldquo;give me a minute to get my wind and I&rsquo;ll be as
strong as ever. That fellow is a mighty husky
brute, though. I&rsquo;ve certainly had my hands full
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his part, the big Irishman felt surprised
that he had not ended the contest before this,
and so expressed himself to his second. &ldquo;Begorry,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;The young felley knows
all the tricks o&rsquo; the game, and then some. I
went to jam me elbow into him when we were
mixin&rsquo; it up there, and he blocked me as neat as
ever you see. Curse me if the young spalpheen
didn&rsquo;t seem to be ixpictin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah, he bane foxy one, you bet,&rdquo; responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the Swede, &ldquo;but you yust go in an&rsquo; smash him
up now. He bane easy for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point the referee announced the recommencement
of the contest, and again the
wrestlers fenced for a hold. Then they dashed
in, grasped each other, and for a moment stood
motionless as though rooted to the spot. Gradually,
each began to exert his strength, ounce by
ounce, seeking by sheer brute force to bend the
other backward. Their muscles swelled and
stood out under the skin, but at first neither
seemed to gain an advantage. Then, slowly,
very slowly, the big sailor bent backward&mdash;further
and further&mdash;until he could stand it no longer.
With a yell he collapsed and went to the
floor, with Drake on top of him. In a second
the athlete had the giant&rsquo;s shoulders touching
the floor, and the referee called a &ldquo;down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the contest should have been over, but
the defeated man would not have it so. With
a hoarse shout of rage he sprang to his feet and
rushed straight at Drake. When the latter saw
him coming he set himself for the onslaught with
a jerk, and a dangerous light burned in his eyes.</p>

<p>The Irishman dashed for him with the speed
and force of a wild bull, and Drake ducked
slightly. Then as the man reached him he
grasped him by the wrists, and straightened up
with a great heave. The sailor went flying over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
his head and shot through the air like a projectile
from a gun.</p>

<p>A cry went up from everybody there, for it
seemed certain that he would be killed. Fortunately,
however, his momentum was so great that
it carried him clear to the wall, where he dove
head first into a bunk. For a moment he lay
stunned, but then staggered weakly out, shaking
his head from side to side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be all the saints,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Oi&rsquo;ve met me
match this night and got the lickin&rsquo; of me life.
The best man won, that&rsquo;s all Oi&rsquo;ve got to say.
Shake hands before ye go, will ye, kid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Drake frankly, extending his
hand. &ldquo;You gave me a hard tussle, and deserved
to win. I hope I never have to stand up
against you again,&rdquo; he added, with a grin, &ldquo;for
you&rsquo;re certainly a dandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he and his followers filed out, and returned
to the training quarters. The first person
they saw when they entered was Reddy, and
he grinned broadly as they came in. Bert had
hinted pretty broadly at the object of their visit
to the forecastle, but had not told Reddy openly
what was in the wind, as in his official capacity
the trainer would not have felt in a position
to sanction the affair. As it was, he awaited
news of the outcome with considerable anxiety,
and seemed much relieved when the whole contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was recounted to him and he learned of its
successful termination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to bed with you now, you worthless
spalpeens,&rdquo; he said at the end of the recital.
But as they were dispersing to their bunk he
called, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad you won, Drake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Drake was on deck and
practising at the usual time, feeling no ill effects
from his strenuous experience other than a slight
stiffness, which bothered him very little. In a
couple of days even this wore off, and the next
day but one from the date of the exciting contest
he broke the record for discus throwing by
a matter of almost six inches, thus justifying the
trainer&rsquo;s judgment.</p>

<p>As for the crew, they treated Drake with
marked respect, and from that day forward nothing
more was heard from them except praise
concerning &ldquo;college athletes,&rdquo; and especially
&ldquo;plate-throwers.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Fearful Awakening</span></h3>


<p class="cap">It was evening on board the <i>Northland</i>, cool,
calm and altogether delightful. Just enough
of twilight lingered to make visible the broad
expanse of ocean, so calm that, if it were not
so vast, one might almost think it an inland lake.
A silver-crescent moon, growing brighter every
moment as the soft light waned, cast its bright
reflection into the quiet water where the dancing
ripples broke and scattered it into myriad points
of gleaming light. As the darkness grew, the
stars came out and added their beauty to the
night.</p>

<p>To the groups of young athletes, lying at ease
in steamer chairs on the deck, the cool quiet of
the perfect evening was most welcome, for it
had been a strenuous day. The hours allotted
to practice had been filled to their limit, and now
it was luxury to lie with tired muscles relaxed
and enjoy the peace and beauty of the quiet night.</p>

<p>For a long time no one spoke, but Tom, who
could never bear to be quiet very long, nor let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
other people be, broke the silence by wondering
what Berlin was like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Reddy who had twice
visited the great German city, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine, but it
sure is laid out queer, with the river running
straight through it, cutting it clean in two.
They&rsquo;ve had to build many bridges, for the
river branches off in more than one direction and
you have to be crossing over the water every
little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read about those bridges,&rdquo; said Bert,
&ldquo;and of the eight immense marble statues that
are to be seen on one of them. The statues represent
the different stages of a soldier&rsquo;s career.
On another is an equestrian bronze statue of
Frederick of Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said loyal Tom, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right for
Berlin, but I think we&rsquo;ve left behind in little old
New York, about everything that is really worth
seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every one laughed, and Axtell said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
one thing in Berlin, you must admit, that not even
New York can boast; the thing we are all more
interested in just now than anything else in the
world, the great Olympic athletic field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brought them around to athletics again
and the talk ran on different events and their
hope of success in each until Dick rebelled. &ldquo;Do
let&rsquo;s talk about something else once in a while,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he remonstrated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wonder we don&rsquo;t all
dream about the Stadium and get up in our sleep
and go through the motions. They say your
dreams are influenced by what has made the
strongest impression on your mind during the
day. At least that&rsquo;s the theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Drake, &ldquo;I can confirm your
theory in part, anyway; for last night I had the
most vivid dream of a hurling match. I suppose
that was because I thought of very little else all
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was quite a little discussion then as to
whether dreams could be controlled by the will
or were entirely involuntary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bert said finally, &ldquo;as opinions seem
about evenly divided, I propose that we all go
to bed to-night with a determination not to
dream of any form of athletics, and, in the morning
report our success or failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order to give their minds a different bent,
they sang college songs for the next hour, then
bade each other good-night, and went to put their
theory to the test.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very determination not to dream
of the athletic contest made it more certain that
he would dream of just that; but, at any rate,
Drake did have a most vivid dream.</p>

<p>He thought that the great day of the meet had
arrived, and, at last, the hour to which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
looked forward for so many weeks. The great
audience had assembled and sat in hushed expectancy,
while he stood ready with muscles tense
and discus poised.</p>

<p>So real was the dream that his body followed
its movements. Slipping out of bed he moved
noiselessly, still sleeping, up the stairs, and, as directly
as if it were broad daylight instead of
black night, on to the practice space on the training
deck, where a portion of the rail had been
removed to facilitate the throwing of the discus.
Here, taking his place in the dream, within the
circle of space allotted to him, he stood firm,
poised the discus and stepped forward a couple
of paces as he threw. But, alas, that circle of
space was only in his dream and in reality he had
passed through the opening in the rail. The two
paces carried him over the edge of the vessel,
through forty flying feet of space, and plunged
him into the dark waters beneath.</p>

<p>The plunge awoke him. As he rose to the surface
he instinctively struck out and kept himself
afloat. Bewildered and half dazed, he asked
himself, &ldquo;Where am I? How in the name of
everything that&rsquo;s horrible, did I get here in the
water?&rdquo; Vain questions to which there came no
answer.</p>

<p>He had fallen with his back to the ship, but
now, as full consciousness came to him, he turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and, to his horror, saw the lights of the <i>Northland</i>
drawing steadily away from him. Without
stopping to reason, he began shouting at the
top of his voice, and swimming with all his
strength after the departing steamer. His one
impulse was to reach it, his one thought that he
must not be left alone there in mid-ocean.</p>

<p>For many minutes he swam madly, desperately,
but soon the brief insanity passed, his self-control
returned, and he realized the uselessness
of the vain struggle. He ceased swimming and,
alternately treading water and floating, to rest
his strained muscles, tried to collect his thoughts
and determine what to do.</p>

<p>As he floated, he forced his mind backward.
One by one the events of the evening on board
the <i>Northland</i> came back to him. The quiet
loveliness of the night, the talk about Berlin,
about the events so soon to take place and about
dreams&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dreams,&rdquo; he said aloud. Like a flash
he remembered his vivid dream of the Olympic
field in Berlin; remembered how in his dream
he stood ready to take his part in the great contest;
remembered the strained muscles, the poised
discus, the forward step&mdash;ah, that was it! He
felt certain that now he had the reason for his
present desperate plight. He must have walked
in his sleep and, in his sleep, slipped overboard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>This plausible solution of the mystery was
some small satisfaction. Question after question
assailed him. How long after he tumbled
into his berth had this happened? Was it hours
afterward? If so, it would soon be daylight and
then he might be able to sight some object that
would help him. Had it happened shortly after
he fell asleep? Then long hours must pass before
the dawn. Stout, husky fellow and strong
swimmer that he was, could he keep afloat
through those endless hours? He knew that an
ordinarily strong man could keep himself afloat
five or six hours, seldom longer.</p>

<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when he went to his
berth. The sun rose at this time of the year at
about half-past four, so that would make five and
a half hours at the most; but the probability was
that an hour or more had elapsed before the
dream came. That would leave four hours or
so before dawn. They would not miss him before
breakfast and that would double the four
hours.</p>

<p>He did not doubt that they would search for
him. If the <i>Northland</i> had been a passenger
steamer, sailing under regular schedule, she
would not have been able to waste hours, perhaps
for one missing passenger. Being under
special charter, her time was at her own disposal,
and he knew that she would return over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
course and send her small boats in every direction
in search of him. But at least twelve or fourteen
hours must elapse before any aid could reach
him.</p>

<p>As this terrible realization came upon him, he
was filled with despair. What use to continue
to struggle for the few hours that his strength
would hold out? It would only be a drawing out
of misery with death surely at the end. Better
by far to hold himself, deliberately under water
and in a few brief minutes end it all. But, no,
he would not. He would keep himself afloat till
daylight. Perhaps the dawn would show him
some floating spar or piece of wreckage to which
he might cling. It was his duty to preserve his
life as long as possible. If at last he must yield
himself to old ocean, he could at least die with
the consciousness that he had not yielded like a
coward, but had fought on until the end with
dauntless determination.</p>

<p>At that moment, as if to reward his courage
and manly resolution, a faint light began to creep
over land and ocean. With a thrill he realized
that the dawn, which he had feared was hours
distant, was at hand, and hope sprang anew. But
as the light grew and the great, desolate expanse
of ocean spread itself out before his eager
eye, despair again seized him.</p>

<p>On every side nothing but that great stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of water. Not a speck as large as his hand upon
its calm, cruel surface.</p>

<p>But wait!&mdash;what was that black object that
caught his eye as he rose to the crest of a wave?
Was it only imagination? a shape born of his
desperate desire? No, there it was again. It
was real.</p>

<p>Swimming with renewed energy he steered
straight for the floating object, but paused again
as a new fear gripped his heart. What if it
were the fin of a shark! If that was what it
was, then he was just hurrying to meet a terrible
death. He would rather drown than suffer such
a death as that. A few moments he hesitated,
but the thought that sharks were not so numerous
in the Atlantic as in the Pacific reassured him,
and he said aloud, &ldquo;Well, it is a last chance, and
I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Resolutely, now, he swam on, until as he rose
to the crest of a large wave, he found himself
near enough to observe that what he had feared
at a distance was a shark&rsquo;s fin was a floating
cask. He instantly recognized it as one which
had been rolled near to the rail of the <i>Northland</i>
for the fellows to sit on. He must have touched
it as he went overboard and it had fallen with
him.</p>

<p>With a cry of joy he reached it, and, after
a failure or two, succeeded in grasping it firmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Now he had a much better view of the ocean.
Again he cast his eager eyes across that great
waste of water&mdash;and his heart nearly stopped
beating. At no great distance and bearing directly
toward him was a large steamer flying
the French colors. Would she see him or would
she pass him by? He scarcely dared hope he
would be seen, he was such a speck on that boundless
ocean. He could only wait with heart aching
with suspense.</p>

<p>Nearer and still nearer came the great ship,
until, after what seemed an age of waiting, she
was within hailing distance. Eagerly he scanned
her for sight of any living being, but he could
see no one moving on her decks.</p>

<p>Stripping the jacket of his pajamas from his
shoulders he waved it desperately, and shouted
with all his strength. Ah, she is passing, she
does not see him! But just as all hope seemed
lost, he saw hurrying figures on board, and a
ringing voice came over the water. &ldquo;Have
courage, we will come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great revulsion of feeling passed over him
and never afterward could he remember just what
happened after that voice reached him, except
that he clung, dazed and almost fainting, to the
cask for what seemed hours, and then&mdash;nothingness!</p>

<p>When he again opened his eyes, he was lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
at length on the deck of the strange steamer,
and kind faces were bending over him.</p>

<p>His story was soon told and he was overjoyed
to learn that the steamer was fitted with wireless
apparatus and that a message would be sent as
soon as possible to the <i>Northland</i>. Almost before
he was missed, the news of his safety would
reach them. With thankful heart and in ineffable
content he lay, finding it hard to assure
himself that death had passed him by, and life,
sweeter than ever before, stretched before him.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Northland</i> the breakfast hour
had come, and all took their places at the table
with unusual alacrity, as they were to report the
success or failure of their effort to control
dreams by their will-power. Soon all were assembled
but Drake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Drake?&rdquo; was the general demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be dreaming yet,&rdquo; laughed Bert.
&ldquo;He sure has met with failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Axtell, who shared Drake&rsquo;s stateroom,
assured them. &ldquo;He has been up this long
while. He had left his berth this morning before
I awoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited a while and then, as he did not
come, Axtell went to find him. In a short time
he returned with the startling news that Drake
did not appear to be anywhere on the ship.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s putting up a joke on us,&rdquo; said Tom
with a half-hearted attempt at a grin.</p>

<p>Everyone hoped that this might be true, but
it did not prevent a thorough search of the ship,
it is needless to say, without result. Great was
the consternation on board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What under the sun could have happened to
him,&rdquo; Dick wondered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows,&rdquo; Axtell answered anxiously.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s have one more look.
He must be hiding somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where, where,&rdquo; Tom cried, at his wit&rsquo;s
end. &ldquo;How could he have disappeared so completely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the question,&rdquo; Bert cried impatiently.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us to find out where, if we
can,&rdquo; and once more the search was begun.</p>

<p>Five minutes more of frantic search brought
no reward. The fellows, now thoroughly panic-stricken,
stood and looked into each other&rsquo;s pale
faces, trying to imagine what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be somewhere on the ship,&rdquo; Martin
persisted, desperately. &ldquo;Nothing else is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The startling news had been carried to Captain
Everett and his voice could now be heard
giving orders for a most thorough search of the
ship. This was done but still without avail.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>At this report their last hopes were dissipated
and all were forced to believe that in some mysterious
way Drake had accidentally fallen overboard.
At this solution of the mystery every
heart was filled with frantic grief, for Drake was
loved by all. Then they all felt an almost irresistible
impulse to fling themselves overboard
and drag him somewhere, somehow, from that
sea of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he has fallen overboard,&rdquo; Axtell said with
a choke in his voice, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have no chance at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Tom cried, throwing himself down in
a chair, &ldquo;poor, poor old Drake; and we are so
powerless to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one chance left,&rdquo; Reddy comforted,
striving to bring back a spark of hope to their
despairing hearts. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right in the steamer
lane and one of them may pick him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly they clutched at this one straw held
out to them and hope was further strengthened
by the fact that the <i>Northland</i> had turned and,
with all steam on, was retracing her course. A
faint hope, at best, they knew, for even if his
splendid strength had held out till then, how
could such a small speck as he must seem on that
boundless ocean, be sighted from the deck of a
steamer? Then, too, the <i>Northland</i> could not
retrace her course exactly and the currents might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
have carried the poor castaway far adrift. A
forlorn hope indeed!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Click! click! went the key of the wireless, and
the operator straightened in his chair as a message
came over the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On board the <i>Northland</i>,&rdquo; it flashed,
&ldquo;Drake rescued this morning by French steamer
<i>Lafayette</i>. Will reach Havre on Thursday at
eleven A. M. Will await <i>Northland</i>. All
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment and the message was in the captain&rsquo;s
hands. Then such wild, uncontrollable
joy broke out on board as the <i>Northland</i> had
never before witnessed. Everybody shook everybody
else by the hand, all talking at once and
neither knowing nor caring what they said.</p>

<p>When, two days later their old comrade stood
among them their joy knew no bounds. They
carried him around on their shoulders and nearly
killed him with their hilarious demonstrations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too good to be true,&rdquo; said Axtell, with his
arm around his chum&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;to have you
back again safe and sound. Say, fellows,&rdquo; he
said, turning to the others, while his old smile
flashed out again, &ldquo;to think that all that came
from walking in a dream. If that&rsquo;s the kind of
&lsquo;stuff that dreams are made of,&rsquo; may none of us
ever dream again!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dynamite Ship</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;In a German port! Germany at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Tom coming slowly back from the
land of dreams, the words spoken in Dick&rsquo;s voice
sounded as if they came from a long, long distance.
With an impatient little shake at being
disturbed, he turned over, and was drifting away,
when Bert&rsquo;s joyous &ldquo;Right-o, Dick, Germany at
last!&rdquo; brought him all the way back again.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes, he remembered with a thrill,
that the <i>Northland</i> was to reach port, the great
port of Hamburg, during the night just passed.
Bert and Dick, fully dressed, were gazing excitedly
from their cabin portholes. At a slight
sound from Tom, they pounced on him, dragged
him from his berth, and landed him before one
of the portholes. &ldquo;Look out there,&rdquo; said Dick,
&ldquo;and then tell us what kind of a gink a fellow
must be that can lie like a wooden man in his
berth on such a glorious morning and with <i>that</i>
to look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It certainly was a glorious morning, and
&ldquo;that&rdquo; Tom had to acknowledge, was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
worth looking at. Just one glance he gave, and
then dove for his clothes. He did not need Bert&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Do hurry up, lazy, and let&rsquo;s get on deck.&rdquo; His
clothes went on with not one bit more attention
to details than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; said Dick, as Tom gave the
last impatient brush to an exasperating lock on
the top of his head that persisted in standing
upright. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just an hour before breakfast,
and we must take fifteen minutes of that to get
everything packed up, for you know we are to
go ashore immediately after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the packing,&rdquo; said impatient Tom,
&ldquo;who wants to stay in this stuffy cabin and
pack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bert sensibly suggested, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get at
it now and get it off our hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wisdom hath spoken,&rdquo; laughed Dick, and
for the next few minutes their cabins were filled
with the sound of scurrying feet, articles slapped
hastily into trunk and bag, and an impatient expression
or two at a bag that would not shut, or a
key that would not turn.</p>

<p>Bert and Tom were ready first, and &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
said Dick, as he thrust his keys into his pocket.
&ldquo;O. K. fellows, come on,&rdquo; and three eager sightseers
flew from their cabin. They never forgot
that next hour on deck.</p>

<p>Before them lay the wonderful river, its waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sparkling and gleaming in the morning sunlight.
And the shipping! Steamships like their own,
freight steamers, barges, tugs, craft of all sorts.
The harbor, the largest on the continent, and
ranking next to London, Liverpool and Glasgow
in commercial importance, teemed with life. Up
and down the river passed vessels of every description,
some of them of a build entirely new to
our three Americans. Anchor chains rattled as
some steamer pushed into position. The hoarse
cries of the sailors or the musical &ldquo;Yo, heave
ho,&rdquo; or its German equivalent, rang out as they
ran up and down ladders at the ship&rsquo;s side, or
bent to the task of hoisting some heavy piece
of freight from steamer deck to barge. Quick
commands and the ready response, &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo;
sounded on every side.</p>

<p>At their docks, freight steamers were being unloaded,
or were discharging their cargoes into
transportation barges fastened alongside. Busy,
noisy, important little tugs blew their shrill
whistles as they steamed along with some steamer
or heavily laden barge in tow. Little any one
in Hamburg Harbor that calm, bright, beautiful
morning, dreamed that when the sun was but a
little higher in the heavens, one of these same little
tugs, under the command of her brave captain,
would perform a deed of heroic daring.</p>

<p>For many minutes, not a word was spoken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the three friends, so completely were they absorbed
in the wonderful scene. Then, as he
drew a long breath, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; said Tom,
and the spell was broken. &ldquo;Makes you realize
there is great work going on in the world,&rdquo;
thoughtfully observed Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wonderfully
interesting,&rdquo; agreed Bert, &ldquo;but what really
interests me most is not what is going on on
water, but what will be going on on land within
a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At his words they wheeled with one accord
and fixed their eyes on the land. Careless now
of all the harbor sights and sounds, they gave
scant heed to the great commercial city with its
miles of river harbor. The one great thought
that dominated every other was that very soon
now their feet would be set on German soil,
and then away to Berlin to match American speed
and skill against the athletes of the world. For
this they had traveled thousands of miles across
the sea, and what would be the outcome? victory
or defeat? When, the trial ended, they should
stand on the deck of this steamer, homeward
bound, would it be with hearts swelling with proud
triumph, or sinking at the prospect of going
home beaten? &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know now
fellows,&rdquo; breathed Tom, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be the answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Bert quietly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you <i>know</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
It&rsquo;s going to be victory, of course. Anything
else is not to be considered for one moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right-o,&rdquo; said Dick, brightening, &ldquo;and here
and now we cross out the word defeat from our
vocabulary and pledge ourselves to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a hand clasp all around to seal the
pledge, they took the cabin stairs with one bound
as the breakfast gong sounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, as he seated himself at the
table, &ldquo;our last meal on board. Let&rsquo;s make the
most of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom assented with comic seriousness,
his face drawn into doleful lines, &ldquo;for we don&rsquo;t
know where we will get the next meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you care <i>where</i> we get it, as long
as we get it?&rdquo; summed up Dick, as the laugh
subsided.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, they stood with the others on
deck, waiting only for the checking of the baggage
to go ashore. As they waited, the busy
harbor again claimed their attention. Six or
seven hundred feet away, a large freight steamer
was rapidly unloading into a barge that waited at
her side. &ldquo;What do you suppose her freight
is?&rdquo; Bert asked of a gentleman beside him who
had been especially chummy with the young
Americans. &ldquo;Oh, it may be anything,&rdquo; laughed
his friend. &ldquo;From silk and linen to dynamite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; said Tom, with a comic shiver, &ldquo;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it&rsquo;s dynamite, I&rsquo;m glad we are no nearer to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled, but replied gravely,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good thing to keep as much distance
between you and any form of dynamite as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are right,&rdquo; said another passenger,
a jolly fellow, who had kept them very merry
during the voyage with his witty sayings, and his
exhaustless fund of funny stories. &ldquo;Everyone
might not be willing to take the chance that
Casey did for the sake of getting even. His
friend O&rsquo;Brien had a way of giving him a very
vigorous slap on the chest by way of greeting.
The blow always came over the breast pocket
where Casey carried his cigars, and a number of
them had been broken. Casey did not fancy this
at all, and a scheme came into his head to get
even with O&rsquo;Brien. He procured a small stick
of dynamite and placed it in the pocket with his
cigars. Filled with satisfaction, he was walking
down the street, chuckling to himself, when he
met his friend Dennis. &lsquo;Phat&rsquo;s the joke?&rsquo; asked
Dennis. &lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; said Casey, shaking with laughter,
and showing Dennis the stick of dynamite in
his pocket, &lsquo;Oi&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of the surprise of
O&rsquo;Brien phwen he hits me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hearty laugh greeted this story, and it had
scarcely subsided when Bert, whose trained sight
very little escaped, drew attention to a vast volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of smoke that was pouring from the stern
of the <i>Falcon</i>, the steamer that carried the load
of dynamite. At the same instant a great confusion
broke out on board of her. Sailors came running
to the deck, and rushed affrightedly to the
rail. The excitement spread to other vessels near
at hand.</p>

<p>A tug, one of the largest, ran alongside the
<i>Falcon</i>, whose crew, pursued by fear, began
jumping or tumbling over her side on to the tug&rsquo;s
deck. Whistles sounded, and vessels near at hand
began drawing away from her with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be on fire,&rdquo; someone said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; answered Captain Everett, coming
up, his face very pale, &ldquo;and part of her freight,
I&rsquo;m told, is several hundred cases of dynamite.
Nothing can save her now. It is only a matter
of minutes, or maybe seconds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the startling news every face blanched, and
every eye was fixed on the fated steamer. It was
a scene to stamp itself on the memory of all. The
sailors, tumbling pell-mell upon the tug, the crews
of the different vessels hurriedly executing sharply
uttered commands, the boats scurrying away like
a flock of frightened birds.</p>

<p>Sure now that all had been taken from the
fated ship, the rescuing tug was steaming rapidly
away, when two men suddenly appeared on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<i>Falcon</i>, and, running to the rail, waved their
hands in frantic appeal for rescue.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the tug did not notice
the men, but soon the puffing of exhaust pipes
grew less noisy and she slowed down. She had
seen the two poor unfortunates, and now the same
question was in the mind of all. What would the
captain of the tug do? What ought he to do?
There was no time to land those on board and
return. Every second lost meant a lessened
chance of going back and making a final safe
getaway. If he left the two men to their fate
it would look like deliberate cruelty; but, on the
other hand, if he went back, he must carry every
soul on board into imminent danger of a terrible
death. Dared he do it?</p>

<p>A moment she hung undecided, her screw
scarcely turning the water at her stern, while all
waited with beating hearts. Then she wheeled,
and with all steam on hurried back. She moved
with great speed, but to the onlookers it seemed
as if she crept through the water. Seconds
seemed like long minutes, until at last the sailors
were safe on deck. Her bow once more pointed
to open water, she steamed away toward safety.
Not yet did they who had followed her every
movement dare to cheer her captain&rsquo;s brave action.
She was not yet safe.</p>

<p>One hundred, two, three, four, five, six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
feet of water at last stretched between her and the
great danger that she had so narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>Now a cheer arose, but scarcely was it heard
before it was drowned in a tremendous roar as
the <i>Falcon</i> sprang bodily from the water. Then
a great column of fire a hundred feet high leapt
up from the doomed ship. Over this hung a cloud
of black smoke which completely hid the vessel
from view, while the sea rocked as if with a submarine
earthquake. The air was filled with steam
and smoke, charred wood, fragments of steel and
iron, and flying cases of dynamite. When the
smoke cleared, which was not for many minutes,
there was not a vestige of the ill-fated <i>Falcon</i>, nor
of the barge at her side.</p>

<p>Many of the cases of dynamite exploded in the
air, seeming to echo the first great, deafening explosion.
A number of them narrowly escaped
falling on the deck of the gallant little tug that
twice had braved destruction. One of them did
indeed graze her stern, ripping up some of the
planks from her deck, carrying away part of her
rail, and throwing down and stunning many of
those who crowded her forward deck. It was a
narrow escape. Had the explosion occurred a
very few minutes sooner many of the cases of
dynamite would have fallen on the tug&rsquo;s deck in
the midst of her crew and those who had fled to
her for safety. No one dared think of the fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
scene of carnage that would have followed.</p>

<p>Many other ships in the harbor barely escaped
destruction. A collier was struck by the flying
pieces of steel and iron, some of them weighing
fifty pounds or more, and her steel plates, nearly
an inch in thickness, were pierced and torn in
many places. By the very force of the concussion
her great smokestacks were crushed flat.</p>

<p>Nor did those on board the <i>Northland</i> entirely
escape the terrific force of the explosion. Their
ship seemed to lift under them, and many were
thrown to the deck, but none received any serious
hurt.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that thought of their own
affairs had been banished from the minds of all
on board during this scene of awful confusion and
mortal peril; but it had passed.</p>

<p>As once more the great river settled into calm,
the work of debarkation went on. A little while
and our young travelers, still thrilling with the
excitement of the scene through which they had
just passed, found themselves at last on German
soil.</p>

<p>The afternoon was very delightfully spent in
&ldquo;doing&rdquo; Hamburg town, and the next morning,
after a quiet night at the hotel, the train bore
them onward toward Berlin, and the fulfillment,
as they believed, of all their hopes.</p>

<p>Knowing that the morning papers would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a full story of the harbor disaster, everyone
straightway possessed himself of a copy, and settled
himself eagerly to read the account. In consequence,
it was a very quiet carful of people as
they scanned the columns with their glaring headlines.
Our three college boys, like all the others,
had a fair knowledge of the German language,
but it was not so easily nor so quickly read as
English, and so eager were they to learn the full
extent of the disaster that they were very glad
to accept the offer of one of their party, who was
a native German, to translate for them.</p>

<p>Soon startled exclamations broke forth, as
they learned that for a distance of twelve miles
windows were broken and chimneys demolished,
tall steel-framed office buildings shaken to their
foundations, and thousands of people had been
in panic from fear of earthquake. In amazement
they heard that great pieces of steel weighing
fifty pounds had been found three or four miles
from the harbor, and that the shock was felt a
hundred miles away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Drake, as he folded up his paper
at last, &ldquo;the wonder is that there was a single
ship left in the harbor, and that we did not all
go to the bottom of the river. I don&rsquo;t see what
saved us, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not to be wondered at that they could
talk of nothing else during the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the journey, but as the train neared their goal,
the much-talked-and-thought-of city of Berlin,
there was a sudden reaction from seriousness to
gaiety. It is not in boy nature to look long on
the dark side of things, and it was a hilarious
party of young Americans that descended from
the train, and wended their way along the streets
of the German city, that till now had only existed
for them between the covers of a geography.</p>

<p>German talk, German faces, German costumes
were all about them, and ears and eyes were kept
very busy with the new sights and sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom,&rdquo; chaffed Bert, as at the hotel
they prepared for dinner, &ldquo;trot out your German.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ach ja,&rdquo; responded Tom, obligingly. &ldquo;Was
wilst du? Du bist ferricht, mein kind? Ich
habe kein geld? Oder wilst du die Lorelei
haben? Ach, wohl, hier es ist,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ich weiss nicht was soll ist bedeuten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das ich so traurig bin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ein mahrchen aus alten zeiten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das kommt mir nicht aus dem sinn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die luft ist&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this point in the quaint German legend
Tom&rsquo;s breath left him as he felt himself lifted
bodily from his feet and laid upon the bed, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
his mouth bound about with a towel snatched
from the washstand. Not until he had, by repeated
inclinations of his bandaged head, promised
&ldquo;to make no attempt to finish the Lorelei,&rdquo;
and to give them his so-called German in &ldquo;as
small doses and at as large intervals as possible,&rdquo;
was he released.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said he, when he was free, &ldquo;such
is the gratitude and appreciation of so-called
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peace restored, the three friends went down
to dinner, softly humming, each in a different key,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ach, du liebe Augustine.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Starry Banner</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The boys were all up early on the day when
the Olympic games were to begin. They
were thrilling with excitement like that of young
soldiers on the verge of their first battle. Here
at last was the goal of their ambition, the day
they had looked forward to through weary
months of effort, the end of their journey from
one continent to another, the final port after the
long voyage overseas. Here they were to pit
themselves against the best the world could offer.
From here the cable was to flash to waiting
friends at home the news of victory or defeat.
And they solemnly vowed it should not be defeat.</p>

<p>Berlin was awake, too. The great city, rising
like a giant refreshed after sleep, was full of stir
and movement. The very air seemed electrified
with a sense of something great impending.
From early dawn the streets had resounded with
bugle calls, as the troops that were to take part
in the great review preceding the games took up
their position. Staff officers in their gorgeous
uniforms were dashing to and fro, and the pavements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
echoed back the measured tread of the
infantry and the clatter of the cavalry. Flags
and bunting fluttered everywhere. Excursion
trains brought in enormous crowds from other
cities to swell the swarming population of the
capital. A general holiday had been proclaimed
and all Berlin was out of doors.</p>

<p>And these vast crowds were swayed not only
by enthusiasm but by hope. At last the German
eagle was to have a chance to scream. The
Fatherland had not fared any too well at previous
Olympic meets. The first prizes that had
fallen to German athletes had been few and far
between. It was not that they lacked pluck and
brawn. This they had in plenty. But they had
not made a specialty of field and track events
and they had been forced to stand aside and see
England and America make almost a clean sweep
at every meet.</p>

<p>But in the four years that had elapsed since
the last games they had thrown themselves into
the strife with all the thoroughness and earnestness
that were their national characteristics. Not
if they could help it would they fail of winning
in their own capital with the whole world looking
on. Sport had become a national craze, and
training, like everything else with the Germans,
had been reduced to a science.</p>

<p>The Emperor himself had rushed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
movement with his well-known dash and vigor.
He was determined that &ldquo;where Germany sat
should be the head of the table.&rdquo; He had issued
orders to his army officers that whenever they
espied in the ranks a promising candidate he
should be given every opportunity for development;
and in more than one case he had relieved
him altogether from military service in order that
he might devote himself to his specialty. He had
hung up costly trophies to be battled for and had
attended many of the meets in person. His own
son, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, was a winner in
the elimination sprints, and would be one of the
Olympic contenders. Everywhere there was a
spirit of deadly earnestness such as had brought
Germany to the fore in so many fields of learning
and music and commerce. There were rumors
flying about of marvelous records made in practice,
of wonderful &ldquo;phenoms&rdquo; to be uncovered
when the time came. And Reddy voiced what
was coming to be a general opinion in the American
quarters, that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them blamed Dutchmen
we&rsquo;ve got to beat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not that this scared Uncle Sam&rsquo;s boys in the
slightest degree. They sniffed the battle from
afar like young war horses, and the prospect of
stiff competition only added zest to the coming
strife. The fiercer the struggle the more glorious
the victory. As Bert put it: &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a procession; they wanted a race.&rdquo; All foes
looked alike to them and they faced the issue with
a buoyant confidence that was not mere bravado,
but based on indomitable courage and self-reliance.
If they were beaten&mdash;and it stood to reason
that in some events they would be&mdash;their
opponents in every case would have to earn the
victory and they would surely know they had been
in a fight.</p>

<p>The fight idea was emphasized by the great
military review that passed before the Emperor.
The crack regiments of the finest army in Europe,
marching with the precision of clockwork, made
up a parade miles in length. Every arm of the
service was represented&mdash;the grim Krupp artillery
rumbling along like thunder, the solid ranks
of the infantry moving as one man, the splendid
Uhlans and Hussars, superbly mounted. It was
a shrewd move on the part of the Emperor&mdash;whom
Dick described as &ldquo;the best advertising
man in Europe&rdquo;&mdash;thus to impress visitors from
all parts of the world with the martial pomp and
power of the German Empire. While these were
to be games of friendly rivalry, and admitting
that &ldquo;Peace hath its victories no less renowned
than War,&rdquo; he figured that it would do no harm
to give a quiet hint that, whether in peace or war,
the Fatherland was prepared to meet all comers.
And the shower of cheers that greeted the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
along the line of march attested the pride felt in
their army by the entire nation.</p>

<p>After the review came luncheon, at which the
Kaiser entertained the Committeemen of the various
nations, and shortly afterward the tide set in
toward the Stadium, where the opening exercises
were to be held that afternoon.</p>

<p>A murmur of admiration rose from the spectators
as they poured in the gates of the magnificent
structure. The builders had fairly outdone
themselves. It was a crystallized dream. The
most brilliant architects in Germany had been
summoned to its construction and given a free
hand in the matter of expense. As a result, they
had erected the finest building in the world designed
for athletic sports. Arranged in the form
of an ellipse, it extended like a giant horseshoe
over fifty acres. The arena itself was open to
the sky, but the seats, rising tier on tier in endless
rows, were under cover. The massive walls,
made of granite, were adorned with statues of
German heroes, and high over all towered a colossal
figure of Germania. The entrances were
flanked by mighty towers and beneath the seats
was an enormous corridor with dressing rooms,
shower baths and every appliance for the comfort
of the athletes. In the center of the vast arena
was the field for the throwing and jumping competitions,
and circling this was the running track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for the racers. Nothing had been overlooked,
nothing neglected. The builders had been able
to profit by the mistakes or omissions of other
nations where meets had been held and they had
reared a structure that was the &ldquo;last word&rdquo; for
beauty and utility.</p>

<p>Through every entrance in one unending
stream poured the crowds of spectators. Thousands
upon thousands, they packed the tiers of
seats until they overflowed. And still they kept
coming.</p>

<p>The Emperor sat in the royal box, surrounded
by his family and a glittering staff. At a given
signal the bands started up the &ldquo;Wacht am
Rhein.&rdquo; The vast multitude rose to their feet
and stood with uncovered heads. Then the
choral societies took up the famous hymn, &ldquo;A
Strong Fortress Is Our God.&rdquo; The noble music
swept over the field and stirred all German hearts
with deep emotion.</p>

<p>Then from the pavilions, each delegation carrying
its national flag, came the athletes, four
thousand in number. They marched in serried
ranks down the field and lined up in front of the
royal enclosure. Bronzed, supple, straight as
arrows, they made a magnificent picture. The
Crown Prince introduced them in a body to his
father in a few well-chosen words, and the Emperor
made one of his characteristic speeches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
reply. At its conclusion he waved his hand, the
ranks disbanded, a hurricane of cheers rent the
air, and the greatest of Olympic meets was on.</p>

<p>For ten days the struggle went on with varying
fortunes. Every event was fiercely contested.
Nothing could be counted on certainly
in advance. Many &ldquo;good things&rdquo; went wrong,
while others who had only been supposed to have
an outside chance carried off the prize. With
every day that passed, it became more evident,
as the pendulum swung from side to side, that the
result would be in doubt almost to the last. They
fought like wildcats, ran like deer and held on
like bulldogs. It was a &ldquo;fight for keeps&rdquo; from
start to finish.</p>

<p>In the rifle and revolver competitions, the
Americans swept the boards. At every range
and every target they were invincible. Crack
shots from all over Europe tried in vain to rival
their scores. They were from the land of Davy
Crockett and there was nothing left for their
opponents but to follow the example of the historic
coon and &ldquo;come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the hundred yard dash, the Americans ran
one, two, three. There was a separate lane for
each runner so that no one could interfere with
another. The timing was by electricity and did
away with any possibility of mistake. The crack
of the pistol started the watch and the breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the tape at the finish stopped it. The system
did away with all disputes and helped immensely
in promoting the friendly feeling that prevailed
throughout the games.</p>

<p>Five points were given to the winner in each
event, three to the second and one to the third.
So that no matter which nation won the first,
another might win the second or third or both,
and thus keep within striking distance in the general
score.</p>

<p>From the first day, the American score began
to climb. But the Germans and Swedes and English
were climbing, too, and it became clear that
it was not to be, as in previous meets, a walkover
for the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>In the field and track events&mdash;what we understand
in this country by athletics&mdash;the Americans
were vastly superior. The broad jump was
theirs, the pole vaulting, the hurdles, the four
hundred metres and fifteen hundred metres runs.
Drake won the discus throw and Snyder hurled
the hammer further than it had ever gone before.</p>

<p>But there were other features in which we had
but few representatives, and in some none at all.
The archery shooting went to England. The
javelin casting with both hands was won by a
gigantic Swede. The horsemanship contest was
carried off by officers of the German cavalry.
France took the lead in fencing and Canada captured
the long-distance walk. The horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
bar work of the Germans was far and away the
best, and her beef and brawn gathered in the tug
of war. In the bicycle race Italy came in first,
and we had to be content with second and third.</p>

<p>All these events swelled the foreigner&rsquo;s score,
and although America captured the Pentathlon
and Decathlon for all round excellence, her lead
on the tenth day was threatened by Germany and
Sweden who were close behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be no two to one this time,&rdquo; Reddy
grumbled. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis glad I&rsquo;ll be if we come out
ahead by the skin of our teeth. We can&rsquo;t seem
to shake them fellers off. They hang on like
leeches. I&rsquo;m thinking, Wilson, &rsquo;twill be up to
you to grab that Marathon, if we&rsquo;re to go back
to God&rsquo;s country with colors flying and our heads
held high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Reddy was so true a prophet that when
at last the momentous day came for the Marathon
race, the German boar was gnashing his tusks
at the American eagle. Only two points behind,
he came plunging along, and victory for either depended
on who won the Marathon.</p>

<p>The day before the race a package was delivered
to Bert at his hotel. It bore the American
postmark and he looked at it curiously. Within
was a letter from Mr. Hollis and a little roll of
bunting. Bert unrolled it. It was a torn and
tattered American flag bearing the marks of
flames and bullets. Across it had been stamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in golden letters: &ldquo;We have met the enemy and
they are ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it a long time in my historical collection,&rdquo;
Mr. Hollis had written. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the identical
flag that Perry flew in the battle of Lake
Erie. I&rsquo;ve had his immortal words stamped on
it. It saw one glorious victory won for America.
I want it to see another. I loan this to you to
tie in a sash about your waist when you run the
Marathon. I&rsquo;m banking on you, Bert, my boy.
Go in and win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert touched it lovingly, reverently. A lump
rose in his throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll win with it.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Glorious Victory</span></h3>


<p class="cap">It was a perfect day for the great race that was
to settle the long-distance championship of the
world. The sun shone brightly, but not too
hotly, and there was a light breeze sufficient to
cool the runners, but not retard their progress.</p>

<p>The Marathon was to start at three in the
afternoon at a point twenty-six miles away from
the Stadium. The most detailed preparations had
been made for the event. The distance had been
carefully measured off by expert surveyors, and
policed from end to end in order to keep a clear
path for the racers and see that the rules were
strictly observed. At every hundred feet stood
a group of soldiers. All traffic had been suspended
by an imperial order. An ambulance,
with Red Cross doctors and nurses, was to follow
and pick up any who might fall out or be
overcome with exhaustion.</p>

<p>The contestants had been taken to the starting
point in automobiles the night before, so that they
might get a good night&rsquo;s sleep and be in prime
condition. Now the temporary training quarters
were humming with bustle and excitement. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
last bath and rubdown and kneading of the
muscles were over and the final words of caution
and encouragement spoken, as the fellows lined
up in readiness for the starter&rsquo;s pistol.</p>

<p>Bert, in superb condition, his skin glowing, his
muscles rippling, shook hands with his friends, as
he stood waiting for the start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the good old college, Bert,&rdquo; said Drake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the team,&rdquo; barked Reddy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the flag,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For America,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; answered Bert, as he touched
the flag at his waist, and the look came into his
eyes that they had learned to know.</p>

<p>A moment&rsquo;s breathless silence, while over a
hundred trained athletes watched the starter, as
he looked along the waiting line and slowly raised
his pistol. A shot, a tremendous roar from the
crowd, a rush of feet like a stampede of steers
and they were off. A moment later Berlin knew
that they had started. Five minutes later, all
Europe knew it. Ten minutes later, America
knew it. Two continents were watching the race,
and beneath the gaze of these invisible witnesses
the runners bounded on. All types were there;
brawny Germans, giant Swedes, stolid Englishmen,
rangy Canadians, dapper Frenchmen,
swarthy Italians, lithe Americans&mdash;each one
bound to win or go down fighting.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>At first the going was rather hard on account
of the great number of contenders. They got
in each other&rsquo;s way. They were like a herd of
fleeing deer, treading on each other&rsquo;s heels.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s first impulse was to get out in front.
Like every thoroughbred, he hated to have anyone
show him the way. The sight of a runner
ahead was like a red rag to a bull. But he restrained
himself. If he were to win that race,
he must use his brains as well as his legs. What
use to waste his strength by trying to thread his
way through those flying feet? Let them make
the pace. By and by they would string out and
the path would clear. In the meantime he would
keep within striking distance.</p>

<p>As he ran on easily, Thornton ranged alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go with you, my pretty maid?&rdquo; he
grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may if you like, kind sir, she said,&rdquo; retorted
Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make it one, two, three for America,
to-day,&rdquo; went on Thornton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk,&rdquo; replied Bert, and
then, as breath was precious, they subsided.</p>

<p>The course led uphill and down, over country
roads and through villages whose quaint beauty
would have appealed to Bert under other circumstances.
But to-day he had no eye for scenery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
no thought of anything but the road that
stretched before him like a ribbon, and the
Stadium, so many miles away.</p>

<p>Five miles, ten, and the pace began to tell.
Some had dropped out altogether and others
were staggering. The sheep were being separated
from the goats. The real runners were
ranging up in front, watching each other like
hawks, intent on seizing any advantage. Most
of them by this time had found their second wind
and settled into their stride. Some were running
on a schedule and paid no attention to their competitors,
serenely confident that in the long run
their plan would carry them through.</p>

<p>But Bert had no use for schedules. To him
they were like the schemes to break the bank at
Monte Carlo, infallible on paper, but falling
down sadly when put to the test. As he had told
Tom on an earlier occasion, &ldquo;it was men, not
time, that he had to beat.&rdquo; So he kept a wary
eye on the men in front and sped along with that
easy swinging lope that seemed so easy to beat
until one tried to do it.</p>

<p>Now fifteen miles had been covered and Bert
let out a link. It would not do to wait too long
before challenging the leaders. Dorner, the German,
and Boudin, the Frenchman, were already
far enough ahead to make him feel a trifle uneasy.
Hallowell too and the Indian were a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of a mile in front and showed no signs of
wavering. Now was the time to wear them
down. Almost insensibly he lengthened his
stride and with every leap decreased the distance.
The crowd that lined the road, quick to detect
the spurt, hailed him with cheers as he sped past,
and the men in front, sensing danger, themselves
put on extra speed and battled to retain the
lead.</p>

<p>And now, Nature took a hand. A thunder
storm that had been brewing for a half hour
past, broke suddenly at the eighteenth mile, and
the rain came down in torrents. It beat against
their faces and drenched them to the skin. It
cooled and refreshed their heated bodies, but it
made the footing slippery and uncertain. It
taxed, too, their strength and vitality, already
strained to the utmost.</p>

<p>In the wild tumult of the elements, Bert exulted.
The thunder roared, the lightning flashed,
and his own spirit shouted in unison. It appealed
to something primitive and elemental in
his nature. And as he ran on in the gathering
darkness, the vivid lightning playing in blinding
flashes about his lithe figure and tossing hair, he
seemed like a faun or a young god in the morning
of the world, rather than a product of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>But he was quickly enough brought back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
reality. He had overhauled Hallowell and the
Indian, and set sail for the French and German
runners, when, just as he dashed round the foot
of a hill, he slipped on the wet going and swerved
against a rock at the edge of the road. A keen
pain shot through his foot, and he saw to his dismay
that his right shoe had been slit from end to
end by the sharp edge of the rock. The injury to
the foot was only a scratch, but, when he tried to
run, the shoe flapped loosely and threatened to
throw him. A great fear came upon him, and
his heart turned sick.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Reddy and the boys had ridden
back by another road to Berlin. The trainer
dropped Tom and Dick at the Stadium and then
whirled back to the hotel. Here the American
band was quartered and down this street the runners
were to pass. Reddy sought out the leader.
A short conference and the band gathered in full
force on the balcony overlooking the street.</p>

<p>Reddy glanced at his watch. They must be
coming now. The leader poised his baton expectantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Reddy confidently, &ldquo;till the first
one gets abreast of the hotel. Then let her go
for all you&rsquo;re worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minutes passed that seemed like hours. Then
there was a stir among the crowds, a craning of
necks, a murmur growing into a roar, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
leading runner came in sight. Reddy took one
look and turned pale. The leader lifted his baton
as the runner drew nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; cried Reddy, clutching at him
fiercely. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second runner appeared and then a third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; groaned Reddy. &ldquo;O, hivins, not
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then down the street came a flying figure.
Reddy needed no second glance. He knew that
giant stride, those plunging leaps. On he came
like a thunderbolt, and the crowd drew back as
though from a runaway horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; screamed Reddy. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in one great crash the band broke out into
the glorious strains of &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert lifted his head. The music poured
through his veins like liquid fire and his heart
almost leaped from his body. His strength had
been oozing away, his breath was coming in sobs.
His shoes had been torn off and cast aside, his
bruised feet tortured him at every stride, and
every ounce of power had been cruelly taxed in
the effort to close up the gap caused by the accident.
Now he was running on his nerve. And
just at this moment, like an electric shock to his
ebbing strength, came the thrilling strains that
might have stirred the dead:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner, oh, long may it wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The flag, his flag, &ldquo;Old Glory,&rdquo; never stained
by defeat since it was flung to the breeze, victorious
in every war for a hundred years, its shining
stars undimmed by time, the pride and boast of
the greatest country on God&rsquo;s green earth! His
feverish fingers touched the sash at his waist.
&ldquo;We have met the enemy and they are ours.&rdquo;
The Star-Spangled Banner!</p>

<p>Now he was running like a man possessed.
Gone was pain, gone were bruises, gone the deadly
weariness that dragged him down. His feet had
wings. His heart sang. His eyes shone. He
seemed inspired by superhuman strength. Like
an arrow he shot past the Frenchman who was
staggering on gamely, and step by step he gained
on Dorner, the gallant German, who had been
dubbed by his admirers &ldquo;The Flying Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flying he certainly was, spurred on by the wild
yells of the German crowds, mad with joy at
seeing their colors in front. But the shouts died
down as Bert slipped by like a shadow, relentless
as fate, close on the heels of the leader, grimly
fighting for every inch.</p>

<p>And now the Stadium loomed up, gay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
flaunting flags, and packed to the doors with a
countless multitude wild with excitement. The
word had been flashed along that a German was
leading, and the crowds were on their feet,
screaming like madmen. The Emperor and
royal family, all ceremony thrown aside, were
standing and shouting like the rest. The American
contingent, despair eating at their hearts, sat
glum and silent.</p>

<p>The twenty-six miles had been measured to end
at the very doors, and the remaining three hundred
and eighty-five yards of the Marathon distance
was in the Stadium itself. Dorner entered
first and Pandemonium reigned. Then a second
figure shot through, running like the wind, at his
belt the Stars and Stripes. And now it was
America&rsquo;s turn to yell!</p>

<p>Down the stretch they came, see-sawing for the
lead. Before them gleamed the tape that marked
the finish. No one had ever yet broken that tape
ahead of Bert in a race. He swore that no one
should do it now.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer. What was it the fellows
had said? &ldquo;For the college.&rdquo; &ldquo;For the team.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For the flag.&rdquo; &ldquo;For America.&rdquo; He nerved
himself for the last desperate spurt. Once more
he called on the stout heart that had never failed
him yet. A series of panther-like bounds, one
wild tremendous leap and he snapped the tape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Again America had matched its best against the
world, and again America had conquered!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a jubilant crowd that made the return
voyage on the <i>Northland</i>, in the words of Tom,
&ldquo;one continuous joy ride.&rdquo; Training was over,
the strain relaxed, the victory won. It had been
a tussle from start to finish, but they had carried
off the prize and one more series of Olympic
games had been placed to Uncle Sam&rsquo;s credit.
Thornton, Hallowell, Texanima, Brady and Casey
had finished among the first ten and shared with
Bert the honors of the Marathon. The Emperor
himself had placed the laurel crown on
Bert&rsquo;s head, and, as Dick said, proved himself
&ldquo;a dead game sport&rdquo; by the gracious words with
which he veiled his disappointment. Cable messages
had poured in on Bert by the score, but none
so pleasing as the one from Mr. Hollis: &ldquo;You
ran a magnificent race, my boy. The Perry flag
is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now they were on their way home with
their hard-won trophies&mdash;home to an exulting
country, whose glory they had upheld and which
stood impatient to greet them with rousing cheers
and open arms and all the honors a grateful nation
could bestow.</p>

<p>The praises rained on Bert had left him as
natural and unspoiled as ever. To him the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
thing was simple. A task had been put before
him and he had done it. That was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas me that did it,&rdquo; joked Reddy, &ldquo;me
and the band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; laughed Dick, &ldquo;though of course
Bert&rsquo;s wind and speed counted for something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of his grit and nerve,&rdquo; chimed
in Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas this that did it,&rdquo; added Bert, as he
reverently unfolded the faded battle flag that had
waved over Perry&rsquo;s glorious squadron. &ldquo;Running
with this, I couldn&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On other fields of struggle and achievement
that flag was to be his inspiration. How fully
he honored it, how nobly he fought for it, how
stainless he kept it will be told in</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
